<p><img alt="3-phase monitor" src="../sites/default/files/3phase_s.jpg" style="width: 570px; height: 1094px;" /></p>
<p>The transmitter block consists of 3 stacked transmitter boards but only a single RF module...</p>
<p><img alt="3-phase tramsmitter" src="../sites/default/files/3phasetx.jpg" style="width: 768px; height: 512px;" /></p>
<p>The&nbsp;5V power, ground, SDA and SCK signals of the three&nbsp;boards are connected via stackable headers so no wires are&nbsp;required. The top board is the I2C master and it operates as normal, except that just before it starts a sampling cycle it sends a command to each of the slaves to initiate their sampling cycles. When the sampling is complete the master requests the results from the slaves and packages all the data into a single packet for transmission to the display.</p>
<p>Next stage is to divert excess energy into the immersion heater and electric underfloor storage heating - hence the big box!</p>

     <p>Thanks Glyn. Most of the elegance is due to your thoughtful PCB design. Being able to link the boards via I2C without wires made it a pleasure to build.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s the code for the master and slave transmitters...</p>
<p><a href="../sites/default/files/emonTx_CT123_Voltage_3phase_Master.html">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/emonTx_CT123_Voltage_3phase_Master.ino</a></p>

<p>I&#39;ve kept the data for the 3 phases separate so I could display them individually but they could easily be combined in the master to work with the standard display code.</p>

     <p>That&#39;s a very neat build, Martin, much tidier than anything so far of mine!&nbsp; I&#39;ll be most interested to see how your project develops on the power diversion front.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My first attempt to divert surplus PV power was based around the standard OEM V&amp;I sketch which measured the power that was flowing at our grid supply point.&nbsp; A professional AC controller (&pound;&pound;&pound;) was then periodically adjusted so as to achieve a balance between import and export.&nbsp; That system did work OK but with some significant limitations.&nbsp; Apart from the expense, its response time was poor, and it did not monitor power continuously.&nbsp; The controller also needed an additional power supply, 24Vac for the one I was using.</p>
<p>My Mk2 version has a completely different approach in that the code for measuring and distributing power is combined.&nbsp; Its operation is fully continuous and the response time is nigh on instantaneous.&nbsp; With a simple DIY output stage, the cost is also greatly reduced.&nbsp; What it does <em>not</em> do, however, is to communicate its operational status to any form of display.&nbsp; Several other people have devised ways of adding this kind of facility.&nbsp; Maybe you will be looking to do the same?</p>
<p>With a single-phase supply, the ideal state is when import and export are balanced.&nbsp; In this condition, there is no charge to the user and no energy is lost to the grid.&nbsp; I wonder how this works with a 3-phase setup? &nbsp; If two phases were in perfect balance, but the third was consuming some power, I presume you would be charged.&nbsp; Could that charge be avoided if some export were allowed to occur such that the net flow across all three phases was zero?&nbsp; This would require an interesting balancing act from some master entity, but I feel sure that such a scheme should be possible once the relevant criteria are known.</p>

     <p>Thanks Robin.</p>
<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve been following your thread with a great deal of interest. The video showing the disc-type meter just hunting around the zero position is a great demo of how well it works. You have a very neat solution there, the precise control it offers really appeals to me and I&rsquo;m definitely going to have a play with a version of it at some point.</p>
<p>In the meantime I have built something similar to your first version using a commercial 3kW controller. At &pound;87+vat it seemed good value as it&rsquo;s very well made and does include the auxiliary power supply....</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../sites/default/files/immersion_controller_open_0.jpg" /></p>
<p><img alt="" src="../sites/default/files/immersion_controller_closed_0.jpg" /></p>
<p>As you can see, I managed to squeeze an emontx into the case and a rubber-duck type aerial into a convenient hole in the top. This just listens to the normal transmissions from the monitor to see if there is any spare power on the phase used by the immersion and if there is it turns the heater on just enough to use it. Not ideal but it works reasonably well. The main problem is that the controller won&rsquo;t go below about 30% power, probably so it can meet the flicker specs. I&rsquo;ve re-programmed the PIC chip it uses to overcome this but obviously this invalidates the warranty and quite possibly the specs too.</p>
<p>I have been looking into improving the monitoring side as I&rsquo;m not happy with just peeking at the power every few seconds. At the moment I measure the power continuously for 3 seconds and then transmit the result, but ideally I&rsquo;d like to monitor the power continuously so I&rsquo;m looking into doing this with a timer interrupt - although I should probably check out what others have done first.</p>
<p>Interesting point you make about 3-phase metering. I wonder if the meter does use a single &ldquo;energy bucket&rdquo; for all 3-phases or if they are treated separately? At the moment I&rsquo;m just considering it as 3 separate supplies as everything in the house just runs off one of the 3 phases.</p>

     <p>Thanks for the update, Martin.&nbsp; I see that your standard of workmanship remains in a league above mine!</p>
<p>Having no idea about how a 3-phase inverter operates, is there any chance of posting something here about this?&nbsp; Or maybe you could point me towards the spec for the inverter which your PV system uses.</p>
<p>This sounds to be a most interesting development, and it would be great if my Mk2 code could be adapted for efficient use in a 3-phase environment.&nbsp; But, for now, I can only guess at how these things might work, which is probably not very helpful to anyone.</p>

     <p>I&#39;m no expert but I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything special about 3-phase inverters. They&#39;re effectively just 3 inverters in one box with the solar power shared between the 3 outputs. This is the one I have...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sma.de/en/products/solar-inverter-without-transformer/sunny-tripower-8000tl-10000tl-12000tl-15000tl-17000tl.html#Overview-9516">http://www.sma.de/en/products/solar-inverter-without-transformer/sunny-tripower-8000tl-10000tl-12000tl-15000tl-17000tl.html#Overview-9516</a></p>
<p>I&#39;m really curious to know how the meter works now though as it might be possible to transfer power between the phases by leaking it out on one phase and then sucking back on another. If the meter only looks at the total power it will see this as zero nett power.</p>

     <p>I have two theories about how the meter works. Either or neither could be right:</p>
<ol>
<li>
		It emulates exactly the mechanical meter. This has 3 disks on the same shaft, the torques add so export on one phase can balance import on another to give nil movement.</li>
<li>
		It emulates 3 separate mechanical meters (each of which ignores export) and the power company that just totals the 3 numbers.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#39;ve found data on one 3-phase meter that has a starting current of 15 mA (input current 5 A from a c.t.) which is the same value as for the equivalent single-phase version, which makes sense to me.</p>
<p>I would presume it does have a &#39;energy packet&#39; that could be taken advantage of, but how is it shared over the phases? It would be great if you could repeat Robin&#39;s experiments and find out.</p>

     <p>Interesting work Martin. I&#39;ll point Noah in this direction, he&#39;s experimenting with three phase dumping at the moment. I was a bit concerned about the proximity of the three 13A sockets with different phases on them I had a nasty experience with two industrial sized photocopiers powered on different phases, the neutral went missing and for some reason the chassis of both went live with me across them, but that was in Poland, where 240V drops to 210V for the first hour of the day when everyone makes their tea!</p>
<p>I was going to ask if that&#39;s an economy 7 tank with two heaters so you could use two phases, I&#39;m not sure if that would be legal though</p>

     <p>mmm, hadn&#39;t thought about the dangers of having the sockets close together but I see the point - I guess that&#39;s why there are specs! Originally I intended to use DIN rail bell transformers, as they are much neater, but the waveform from all the ones I tried was awful.</p>
<p>They are pretty safe where they are, at ceiling height inside a cupboard, but I would like to obey the rules. Putting the sockets 1.5m apart isn&#39;t very practical so&nbsp;if I put the sockets and transformers inside a box would that be acceptable?</p>
<p>It is an Economy 7 tank but I plan to dump any excess power into the electric floor heating, which acts as a storage heater and normally comes on during the Economy 7 period, so there&#39;s no real need to power both immersion heaters.</p>

<p>They are clearly labelled with the phase colours, they are dedicated to a specific purpose and if you are confident that the sockets will not be used for things like portable tools, then it&#39;s hard to see where the danger is. I would certainly not have sockets on different phases in the same room, and especially in a kitchen, utility room or workshop. I tend to view &#39;rules&#39; as for the obedience of idiots and the guidance of wise men.&nbsp; You could most likely cover yourself with a simple label &quot;These sockets must only be used for Energy Monitor &quot;.</p>

     <p>Hello Martin!</p>
<p>I&#39;ve some questions about your system:</p>
<p>1.) Are SDA, SCL, GND and PWR (5V) all the connections that are needed between the EmonTx modules?</p>
<p>2.) Does every EmonTx have its own 3,3V regulator or is there only one on the master-board?</p>
<p>I&#39;m building a system similar to your&#39;s, measuring total power consumtion of the house, power consumtion of the heatpump (for hot water and heating the house) and the power of the photovoltaic installation I plan to install in a few years (about 8-8,5kW should be possible on the roof of my house).</p>
<p>I allready got most of the hardware, only some components (3,3V regulator, oscillator and ATmega for the 3rd EmonTX), 2 power supplys and the 6 CTs (orderd in China) are missing.</p>

     <p>Hi jb79,</p>
<p>1) Yes, SDA,SCL, GND and PWR are all the connections you need. I left the reset pin in place too, mainly because I didn&#39;t want to cut any more pins off the headers than I had to, but it isn&#39;t required. Obviously if you do go for a single regulator you&#39;ll need the 3.3V pin too.</p>
<p>2) I used a 3.3V regulator on each board as I thought it would minimise noise since the 3.3V line is used as the ADC reference. They&#39;re cheap enough but the concept would work with a single regulator if you want to go that way.</p>
<p>Good luck with your project, it sounds interesting.</p>

     <p>Hello again Martin,</p>
<p>I just installed the scripts on my 3 EmonTx boards and connected them together with the connections I posted 2 days before. The slave boards also share the 3,3V supply because I didn&#39;t have the voltage regulator here.</p>
<p>The one with the rf part gets the master script, on the others I installed the slave script (one with address 2, one with address 3).</p>
<p>First it seems to work but it looks like there are some problems. The system isn&#39;t running as smooth as I expected.</p>
<p>I often get 65535 values from the middle slave board and sometimes the green leds turn on for some seconds. For me it looks like the boards are performing a lot of reboots.</p>
<p>Did you insert pull up resistors to the I2C bus lines, if yes, what value did you use?</p>
<p>Maybe that causes my problems.</p>

     <p>I didn&#39;t use any extra pullup resistors, the internal weak pullups seem to be enough.</p>
<p>The code I used for the Wire interface is just taken from the examples in the Wire library.</p>
<p>It might be worth trying those to make sure your hardware setup is working ok.</p>

     <p>hi... i know its has been a few months since last post but i&#39;m monkey&#39;ing arround with this one, have a few q&#39;s:</p>
<p>1. in the first post on the pic&#39;s each board has 2 jacks connected... is that 2 CS clamps on each phase or? ahould there not be only one?</p>
<p>2. in the code for the master it says:</p>
<pre>
Other files in project directory (should appear in the arduino tabs above)
	- emontx_lib.ino</pre><p>where do i get that one?</p>
<p>3. I want to add a water meter since it&#39;s within 1 meter from my fuse box... its a pulse type (reed switch activated by magnet in meter)... i guess its no problem but could i get a bit of help on that? i have tried to mix together some code here:</p>

<p>4. I also have a heat meter next to the water meter, it has an optical port... my knowledge on the emontx are very limited but does it have enough unused pins on the chip so that 1 serial port can be added? the hardware is very simple for the optical port.. 1 IR LED to send and one IR Receiver look at this pic</p>

     <p>Not having used this code myself, I don&#39;t know how everything is set up, but:</p>
<p>- are you sure that the name of the file you&#39;re looking for is correct?&nbsp;</p>
<p>- what is the problem that you&#39;re seeing when trying to compile the code that you wish to use?&nbsp;</p>

     <p><a href="../sites/default/files/emontx_lib.html">This is the emontx_lib&nbsp;file</a> I used originally. It&#39;s the one that came&nbsp;in the standard emonTx_CT123_Voltage folder in the emonTx firmware package. There&#39;s hardly anything in the file.</p>
<p>The CT1 jack is usually used for the house supply but they are both treated the same by the firmware. You just need to make sure that whatever you are using to receive the transmissions is using the data from the correct CT input.</p>
<p>As&nbsp;calypso_rae said, you should probably make sure the original files compile without problems before you start making changes.</p>

     <p>btw.... trying to understand the GLCD.... are you just using the standard examples or have you tweaked the code to display the different phases?</p>
<p>i would love to display then seperate but also an option to display combined would be nice</p>

     <p>Hey Martin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Newbie here and very intrigued by your project.</p>
<p>I wonder if I could use that as well as a power analyzer. ( a 3 phase Fluke costs well over 3000 euro)</p>
<p>I need to measure house mains power for fluctuations. Mostly 3 phase + neutral.</p>
<p>Voltage, not current.</p>
<p>thanks, Permeke</p>

     <p>I am sure you could, but it does depend on what you expect. You are unlikely to be able to have real time harmonic analysis, for example, and while you should be able to capture one cycle of waveform for later analysis, the resolution (number of samples) will be less than the professional instrument, and of course without access to other highly accurate meters for calibration, the accuracy will be significantly lower too.</p>
<p>However, you will still have a useful tool that should help with diagnosing power problems in general. If you only want to see and record voltage fluctuations (and you are not too concerned with absolute accuracy), then you should have absolutely no difficulty. In fact, if all you want to do is record voltage fluctuations, you might not need 3 processors - it will be worth doing the maths regarding performance.</p>

     <p>Hi Martin,</p>
<p>Thank you for sharing your project, I&#39;ve just enroled&nbsp;in OpenEnergyMonitor so pardon my n00b&nbsp;Q&#39;s</p>
<p>I&#39;m looking for a way to measure the same and use the&nbsp;divert excess energy ( or better say the energy left to use on my grid) for charging an electric car.</p>
<p>Q: Could anyone help me out with this beginners question, the &quot;stacking&quot; of these boards is that just as simple of adding the&nbsp;Stackable Header on the (correct place? which is?) on the boards and then push them together ?</p>
<p>Is there any information what size stackable header and where to place them on the boards?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wxll</p>

     <p>Does this, the 3rd sentence in the top post, not tell you: &quot;The 5V power, ground, SDA and SCK signals of the three boards are connected via stackable headers so no wires are required.&quot;</p>
<p>You can identify these from the pcb layout and schematic on solderpad, or just look at the silk screen if you have a board. (The 5 V is labelled &quot;PWR&quot;)</p>

     <p>Thanks!,</p>
<p>I saw that 3rd sentence however that did not make me feel that confident it was that simple, just connect up and switch on the power. The whole concept or stackable headers is new to me, like a Q in my head &quot;can you really pile up all the boards?&quot;, especially as data seems to go bidirectional as I understand from your posting on one wire and not like a serial cable. Just getting into this and did not work with any of these hardware lnks like the&nbsp;I2C lbefore.</p>

     <p>Many multi-drop bus systems work that way. There is often (not always) one &quot;controller&quot; that initiates proceedings, either by issuing a command to one or more slaves or requesting data from one named slave, then the slave that&#39;s been addressed responds. Each device usually listens before transmitting, and in many cases they also listen as they transmit so are capable of recognising a conflict on the bus (two transmitting at once) and can react accordingly.</p>
<p>There&#39;s plenty on the I<sup>2</sup>C bus that Google will find for you.</p>

     <p>Thanks Martin.</p>
<p>I&#39;m struggling with your code a bit, I&#39;m new to sketches and can&#39;t find anything to explain this.</p>
<p>In your master you have;</p>
<p><em>typedef struct { int power1, power2, power3, Vrms; } PayloadTX;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // neat way of packaging data for RF comms<br />
	PayloadTX emontx[3];</em></p>
<p>Does this mean&nbsp;1 packet&nbsp;is sent with 3 parts,&nbsp;first the data for phase 1, then phase 2 and finally phase 3?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been trying to receive the data with;</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/RFM12B_Simple/tree/master/Rx_SimpleRFM12B_demo" title="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/RFM12B_Simple/tree/master/Rx_SimpleRFM12B_demo">https://github.com/openenergymonitor/RFM12B_Simple/tree/master/Rx_Simple...</a></p>
<p>and all&nbsp;I can get is phase 1.&nbsp;I&#39;ve tried&nbsp;different ways to modify it but&nbsp;I can&#39;t find any info on how&nbsp;to&nbsp;get the data for&nbsp;phases 2 and 3.</p>

     <p>Here, emontx is an array of structs. That means the 3 sets of values for the 3 phases are stored in memory sequentially. This is all standard &#39;C&#39; language.</p>
<p>The rf library sends the one variable emontx as a continuous sequence of 24 bytes (2 bytes per integer x 4 integers per struct x 3 structs in the array).</p>
<p>The Rx_SimpleRFM12B_demo has the &quot;standard&quot; struct for the data and it reads only that. If you modify emontx in the receiving sketch to be the same as the sending end (as you quoted above), then you can access the 3 array elements, like &quot;phase3_Grid=emontx[2].power1&quot;.

     <p>I think you can not stack several shields - the analogue inputs on each shield would all be on the same pins on the Arduino PCB.</p>
<p>The stacked emonTx V2&#39;s work because stacking connects power supplies and the serial one-wire interface. It should be possible to interconnect emonTx V3&#39;s similarly but the physical stacking and interconnection arrangements need to be different.</p>

     <p>I am interested in something similar to monitor all of the circuits in my fuseboard. As these are EmonTx v2, is there a direct replacement to achieve what&#39;s pictured in Martins original post?</p>
<p>Was looking at the emonTx Arduino Shield and stacking, but I don&#39;t think its going to be possible.</p>

     <p>It&#39;s definitely not possible to achieve this by stacking EmonTx Shields, you would need to stack pairs of Arduino plus Shield.</p>
