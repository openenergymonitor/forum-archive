        <div class="content"><p>When the sun is shining, and the immersion heater is cycling away merrily, it&#39;s tempting to think of using other types of load which could consume surplus power more beneficially for our purposes.&nbsp; Although a water heater doesn&#39;t mind being cycled on and off, other types of appliances would no doubt complain if given this kind of treatment.&nbsp; Battery chargers and heat-source pumps spring to mind.&nbsp; If these appliances are to be used as dump-loads at any stage, they will need to remain on for a minimum amount of time without interruption.</p>
<p>It&#39;s all too easy for us humans to take a quick look around and decide that &quot;now&quot; would now be a good moment to activate some load or other.&nbsp; What we are actually saying is that there appears to be sufficient surplus power at present to support the intended activity for the forseeable future.&nbsp; But how can we get an automated system to take these decisions for us?&nbsp; First, we need to re-think the situation in terms that the control system can analyse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of my Mk2 PV Router, the main source of information is the &quot;energy bucket&quot; which provides a continuous representation of the energy state of the premises &quot;now&quot;.&nbsp; The control system will also know the on/off state of any loads that it can control, but is unlikely to know whether any given load is capable of consuming power.&nbsp; A thermostat, for example, might have opened.</p>
<p>Given this simplified view of the world, under what circumstances do we want our control system to commit to turning on appliance X for a minimum duration of Y ?&nbsp; One possibility might be to have a small appliance as our first dump-load, and if surplus power ever exceeds that load&#39;s rating then it&#39;s time to activate appliance X.&nbsp; Another approach might be to check for what proportion of the last minute a conventional dump-load (such as a 3 kW immersion) has been active.&nbsp; If that proportion is found to have exceeded a certain threshold, then it&#39;s time to activate appliance X.&nbsp; The criteria for activating a load that needs continuous power will no doubt need to be different for different situations.</p>
<p>Having taken the decision to apply power to appliance X for a minimum duration of Y, the consumption of any conventional dump-loads will need to be reduced accordingly, otherwise penalty changed are likely to be applied by the meter.&nbsp; The easiest approach at this stage may be to immediately reset the diverter system back to its starting point.&nbsp;&nbsp; If any surplus power is still available, the system will soon be able to find its own level again.&nbsp; But if there is now longer any surplus power, the safest state for the diverter&#39;s control logic to be in is back at Square One, with the energy bucket empty and all conventional dump-loads firmly off.</p>
<p>Once appliance X has been activated, it will need to remain on for a minimum duration of Y.&nbsp; During this period, although still being controlled by the diverter, appliance X should be regarded as part of the baseload of the premises because the diverter is no longer at liberty to turn it off if circumstances change.&nbsp; While appliance X needs to remain on, other dump-load(s) should ideally be available so that the Router can always perform its primary duty of balancing consumption against generation whenever surplus power is present.</p>
<p>When duration Y has expired, the control logic will again have to make a decision about the future state of appliance X.&nbsp; One simple approach might be to simply turn it off immediately, but that same appliance could then become turned on again very shortly afterwards.&nbsp; Such repetitive power-cycling would seem undesirable.&nbsp; A better approach might be to check the level in the energy bucket.&nbsp; If this level is above zero, that means there is still some surplus power within the premises in which case appliance X could reasonably remain on; otherwise it should be turned off.&nbsp; The criteria for de-activating a load that needs continuous power for as long as possible will require careful thought.</p>
<p>So that&#39;s a descriptive version of how a load that requires continuous power could be incorporated as a dump-load.&nbsp; But what would this look like in code?&nbsp; In the standard case, where there are one or more conventional dump-loads which can be switched on or off at any time, the control logic is little more than:</p>
<pre>
if the energy level is sufficiently high
..turn on the next available dump-load
else
..if the energy level is sufficiently low
....turn off the next available dump-load</pre><p>Now, having added some &quot;continuous&quot; loads into the mix, we have a somewhat more complex picture:</p>
<pre>
boolean resetNow = false;
for each load in the &quot;continuous&quot; category
..if the load is already on
....if its timer is still running
......leave the load on
....else
......if the requirement is met for leaving the load on
........leave the load on
......else
........turn the load off
..else // the load is not already on
....if the requirement is met for turning the load on
......turn the load on, resetNow = true
....else
......leave the load off
if (resetNow)
..deactivate all conventional loads and empty the energy bucket
else
.. //for the conventional dump-loads
..if the energy level is sufficiently high
....turn on the next available dump-load
..else
....if the energy level is sufficiently low
......turn off the next available dump-load</pre><p>In the case of my Mk2 Router, this kind of logic would be repeated at the start of every new mains cycle.&nbsp; To minimise the processing overhead, floating point maths should be avoided wherever possible.&nbsp; This logic, however, is no longer simple, and there is a real cost of getting it wrong.&nbsp; If, for example, conventional dump-loads were to be active at inappropriate times, penalty charges would be correctly applied by the meter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, I&#39;ve said nothing about Anti-flicker.&nbsp; Anti-flicker mode is just a simple way of using rather more of the meter&#39;s penalty-free zone than would otherwise be the case.&nbsp; For simple systems, it makes a lot of sense to control dump-loads in this way.&nbsp; But for a complex system, in which there are a number of loads of different types, AF mode should be used with great care.&nbsp; When running in AF mode, the energy level is never far from the meter&#39;s chargeable thresholds when decisions need to be taken.&nbsp; When switching between loads, the control logic requires a certain amount of time to make informed decisions, and time at this stage of the proceedings is in very short supply.&nbsp; The consequence of repeatedly just failing to comply with the meter&#39;s criteria can be very costly.</p>
<p>Having thrown this initial post together very quickly, I make no guarantees as to the accuracy or useability of its content.&nbsp; But I hope that it will provide food for thought, and I look forward to other people&#39;s ideas being added to this thread.</p>

     <p>This is of great interest to me. I am in the process of getting solar PV installed at my home (next week hopefully) and I have every intention of getting one of your Mk2 Routers and using it to divert excess power (I am the one who was bugging you on email a few weeks ago ;)).</p>
<p>My issue is I already have solar evacuated tubes on the roof which are very good at heating my cylinder in the summer months. I barely ever have to activate my cylinder heating element in summer. So this means during the months I will be getting the most PV generation, I will already have a cylinder sitting at between 60-80 degrees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In winter dumping all excess to my cylinder will work great. But in summer I need to divert to something else. And that something else has been perplexing me! Because, as you point out, most of my other loads in the house would not like being switched on/off rapidly.</p>
<p>So any system that allowed me to divert to something, say a dishwasher, for a guaranteed 2hrs for example, would be perfect for my scenario. The rules surrounding what &#39;continuous&#39; loads are available and ready for diversion could become quite complex however. Consider the dishwasher again, I would only want that fired up if I had a full load of dishes. So I would need some way of &#39;enabling&#39; the load so that the PV router would know it is available.</p>
<p>I think we are perhaps getting beyond the realm of an Arduino controller for this sort of thing. This will require more complex automation logic which is responsible for enabling/disabling various loads and potentially even allowing load times to be dynamically set, and then we leave the relatively simple on/off logic you outlined in your post to the PV router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have quite a bit of experience in home automation software, well in one particular piece of software - openHAB (<a href="http://www.openhab.org" title="www.openhab.org">www.openhab.org</a>). I think this would be a perfect fit for this type of control. And I would be very happy to work with you at integrating openHAB with the Mk2 PV router if you think this approach has some merit.</p>
<p>In reality the design will be quite generic, perhaps using MQTT, and then any automation system can be used to interface with the router and enable/disable these continuous loads.</p>

     <p>I&#39;ve been running many loads successfully for nearly some 2 years including air source heat pumps and battery chargers very successfully with my own modification of the Mk2i code which Robin is well aware of. I have modified the code to run a mixture of anti flicker and normal mode dependent upon the actual load being used. It also prioritizes loads and very rarely does it result in any import from the grid.</p>

     <p>summerboy, how do you deal with the electronic controls in most modern dishwashers and washing machines? &nbsp; After a power-fail, mine &quot;reboots&quot; into a default off state. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I could set mine up so that it would do its cycle when the mains comes on, I&#39;d need to be there to re-select the cycle etc.</p>

     <p>Sumnerboy, if your dishwasher is to be a regular feature of your daily routine, then you should be able to regard it as a continuous load that requires period X of continuous power when criterion Y has been met.&nbsp; On days when it is full and switched on, it will start up at the appointed time and consume power; otherwise, it won&#39;t.</p>
<p>My mother has this kind of system for her dishwasher which she runs overnight on Economy 7.&nbsp; If the unit is not sufficiently full, then she doesn&#39;t switch it on.&nbsp; So although power is allocated by the 24h timer that&#39;s plugged into her mains outlet, no energy is consumed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t promise any bespoke code for you of this type but would be happy to supply you with some &#39;&#39;Mk2&#39;&quot; hardware to run it on :)</p>
<p>*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Tinbum, sorry, I can&#39;t see any reason for running some loads in normal mode and some in anti flicker.</p>
<p>In anti flicker mode, loads are likely to be cycling at around 0.5Hz (one second on, one second off).&nbsp; Which of your loads can cope with this kind of treatment yet can&#39;t cope with faster rates of cycling?</p>
<p>As I said at the top of this thread, I think loads need to be categorised into two types: those that can be cycled rapidly, such as water heaters; and those that can&#39;t, such as battery chargers - or dishwashers.&nbsp; The latter type I regard as &quot;continuous&quot; loads, and these need to be held on for a minimum duration as you do with your various timers, whatever the weather.</p>
<p>The former type I regard as &quot;conventional&quot; or &quot;general purpose&quot; dump-loads, and they can be used to mop up whatever surplus power is left.&nbsp; Whether they do so within Normal mode or anti-flicker has no real bearing on anything, IMHO.</p>
<p>If you feel that your code can make a useful contribution to this debate - either in its original form or with my recent additions - please feel free to post it here.</p>

     <p>Thanks Robert - do posts always get reviewed like this, or just for new users?</p>
<p>dBC - yep that is a valid point. But as Robin pointed out I would just manually schedule the dishwasher for the middle of the day, when it is most likely to have the most PV generation, and then the PV router can decide if there is enough to kick it off. It wouldn&#39;t be perfect but by tying in rules which monitor weather forecasts (potentially) we can probably improve things further.</p>
<p>It is for these sorts of reasons that I believe integrating the PV router with some more complex home automation software has a lot of merits.</p>
<p>Robin - my solar is getting installed this week so once it is in and operational I will be figuring out exactly what I need and will most definitely be in touch. I pointed another chap from NZ in your directly recently and he has just posted a picture of a PV router all setup and diverting power. Do I get a commission ;)?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>What are types of dump loads are people using? Tinbum you mentioned battery chargers - what sort of batteries are you charging? Looking for ideas on how else to divert since my evacuated solar tubes will handle all my hot water during the highly productive summer months!</p>

     <p>I seem to have confused myself a little bit in my previous post...apologies!</p>
<p>Due to the electronics in the dishwasher, as dBC pointed out, it would need to remain on and powered up so that the timer can kick in when required and run the dishwasher program. So that means I would have to set the dishwasher timer to run at the same time each day (that it was full and ready), and then have my PV Router configured to check PV generation at that &#39;run time&#39; and decide whether to let the dishwasher run, or shut it off.</p>
<p>So in effect the router would be turning OFF that continuous load if there was not sufficient generation, rather than turning it ON is there was enough. But this requires synching of the dishwasher timer and the PV router &#39;generation check&#39;.</p>
<p>This is not ideal as my dishwasher only has a &#39;delay start&#39; timer (which is by the hour), not a &#39;run at&#39; timer. So I am not convinced running this type of load using diversion is really all that feasible - unless I am missing something...?</p>
<p>What I really need is a &#39;connected&#39; dishwasher...something I can &#39;talk&#39; to over IP and control via openHAB. Then the PV Router can just signal&nbsp;openHAB to indicate there is extra power available and openHAB can decide whether it should run the dishwasher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which goes back to my earlier question...what other types of dump load are people diverting to (since it doesn&#39;t really look like I can use my dishwasher)?</p>

     <p><em>Tinbum - what are you charging? Is it a battery bank for use during non-solar periods?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I have a large battery bank that&nbsp;I use for powering everything when the sun is down so it needs charging every day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Agreed, but are you saying that you can run your battery chargers in anti-flicker mode?

This is not the same as anti-flicker mode</em>.</p>
<p>Yes and with no problems at all other than&nbsp;substituting one&nbsp;small component within them. I&#39;ve been running them for nearly 2 years like this. The chargers running in AF are 1kw each, and yes they cycle on and off as, no, there isn&#39;t sufficient power to keep them on all the time. I&#39;ve also been running&nbsp;them with a meter with a 1000J bucket. As the chargers ramp their output they don&#39;t operate at 1Hz. It&#39;s taken much very&nbsp;fine tuning but it works perfectly and it doesn&#39;t result in import from the grid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My&nbsp;sequence is;</p>
<p>load 1&nbsp;(charger 1)&nbsp;cycles on/off in AF first</p>
<p>once there is 1kW+ of suplus Pv then 1&nbsp;will therefor be on constantly and charger 2 will cycle on/off in AF</p>
<p>once there is 2kW+ of surplus PV then 1 and&nbsp; 2 will be on constantly and charger 3 will&nbsp;cycle on/off in AF</p>
<p>once there is 3kW+ of surplus PV then 1,2,3 will be on constantly and charger 4 will cycle on/off in AF</p>
<p>once the is 4kW+ of surplus&nbsp;PV&nbsp;charger 4 (3kW) will come on (with timers not in AF)&nbsp;and 2,3,4 will go off</p>
<p>at 4kw+ charger one&nbsp;cycles in AF again and so the sequence continues.</p>
<p>For anyone having a&nbsp;battery bank that has cost &pound;1000&#39;s the first priority&nbsp;is&nbsp;to charge them with every single bit of surplus power available. Imagine a really dull rainy&nbsp;day in mid December. You simply can&#39;t do that with them as a continuous load.</p>

     <p>tinbum, what sort of batteries are you using.... lead acid, lithium ion etc? &nbsp;Just about every battery technology benefits (in longevity and charging speed) from various charging algorithms designed for that chemistry. &nbsp;For example lead acids like a constant current phase, followed by a constant voltage phase, followed by a trickle phase. &nbsp; How do you manage that while pulsing the supply to the charger?</p>

     <p>The batteries are lead acid (Rolls). I work on the principle that its better to be putting something in than not, and they are working in the bulk stage.</p>
<p>It must also be remembered that its only 1kW that is turning on and off. I also have direct DC PV charging to the batteries and with solar charging you are always at the mercy of the sun.</p>
<p>The actual charging is done in 3 stages bulk, absorb and float which are controlled by the MPPT solar DC charger and the charger (Trace)&nbsp;that is number 6 on the diverter. In my&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;above&nbsp;I have slightly simplified it because the actual charger loads will actually reduce as the batteries charge and as more chargers come on.</p>
<p>Once&nbsp;I have the 3 phase meter problems sorted&nbsp;I will be changing my system as&nbsp;I will be installing 3 sunny backups, one on each phase. They will do most of the battery charging along with the DC MPPT charger. There will still be some charging using the Mk2i but from the PV on my other 3 phase supply.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, this is just how my Mk2i rev5 sketch works.&nbsp; Only the lowest priority load is cycled (in either Normal or anti-flicker mode as selected), and all higher priority loads remain fully on.&nbsp; To drive multiple outputs is just a matter of allocating the IO pins for them; the necessary control logic is already within the sketch.</p>
<p><em>once the is 4kW+ of surplus PV charger 4 (3kW) will come on (with timers not in AF) and 2,3,4 will go off</em></p>
<p>This is the &quot;continuous load&quot; idea which is the main reason that I started this thread.&nbsp;&nbsp; As I see it, &quot;continuous&quot; loads become part of the background consumption and therefore play no part in the the primary activity of the Mk2 which is to balance energy consumption against energy generation.</p>
<p><em>at 4kw+ charger one cycles in AF again and so the sequence continues.</em></p>
<p>Yes, if there is any surplus power while the &quot;continuous&quot; load is on, it will be diverted to the first available conventional load in whichever mode is selected, either Normal or AF.</p>
<p>As I see it, the extra functionality for &quot;continuous&quot; loads could be incorporated into the latest version of Mk2i rev5 code (rev5e) with very few changes.&nbsp; It may be best for the RF overhead to be removed, otherwise it all gets rather complicated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Downloads page of my <a href="http://mk2pvrouter.co.uk/">website</a>, there&#39;s a multi-load Mk2 sketch without RF called <a href="http://mk2pvrouter.co.uk/media/71bdc09b379e5b2bffff8058d4355564.ino">Mk2_multiLoad_CAT5_2.ino</a> (sorry, the name gets scrambled when the file is downloaded).</p>

     <p><em>Yes, if there is any surplus power while the &quot;continuous&quot; load is on, it will be diverted to the first available conventional load in whichever mode is selected, either Normal or AF.</em></p>
<p>I can allocate this for any individual load and not as a global setting. So for example my heaters/ immersions etc are in normal mode but chargers in AF.</p>

<p>In my code the turning off sequence is much altered from yours. Certain items may have initially been held on by a timer but once that time is up it doesn&#39;t mean that load will actually turn off. So what was a low priority load at the beginning may actually become a high priority load. For example&nbsp;you wouldn&#39;t want an&nbsp;ASHP on when the PV wasn&#39;t going to be good enough to drive it without import, eg first thing in the morning. But when the first few loads are on its probable that the&nbsp;PV has got to a&nbsp;sufficient level to be able to drive it. You then want to continue using that as its COP is greater than 1, which is what an element is. All the time you don&#39;t want import though so the original higher priority loads become the low priority and switch on and off so the ASHP remains on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>As I see it, the extra functionality for &quot;continuous&quot; loads could be incorporated into the latest version of Mk2i rev5 code (rev5e) with very few changes.</em></p>
<p>The basis is already done, as you&#39;ll see in the copy of my sketch that you have.Your description in the first post is basically just how my code works i think.</p>
<p>Re making my code available I&#39;m happy to do, but more on a one to one basis as through the code is not complex using it and setting it up correctly&nbsp;is.</p>

     <p>In most cases&nbsp;I would think most people will use the Mk2i&nbsp;in normal mode and to be honest&nbsp;I would. Initially with your early versions of the sketch, which mine is based on, it was vital to have very accurate calibration if AF was to be used or there would be import from the grid. (Iv&#39;e not checked your newer AF method yet).&nbsp;My meter had a very small energy bucket, about 1/3 of the &#39;standard&#39; meter so that became even more vital.</p>
<p>I think having normal mode results in less possibility of import as the energy bucket should be nearer the center and so should a load elsewhere be turned on or the PV reduces theres a bit more left in it&nbsp;for its&nbsp;reaction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having it in also&nbsp;just&nbsp;gives greater&nbsp;flexibility, who knows what someone is going to power next!</p>

     <p>OK, that makes sense.&nbsp; In simple terms, &quot;normal&quot; mode is indeed the safer option in which to run a MK2 Router.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; once a system has been properly calibrated and found to be working satisfactorily in AF mode, I see no reason to ever revert to normal mode.&nbsp; The only advantage of&nbsp; &quot;normal&quot; mode is that the action happens more quickly when minimal surplus power is available.&nbsp; Otherwise, between the infrequent bursts of power, it could appear that the Router is not actually doing anything.</p>
<p><em>Iv&#39;e not checked your newer AF method yet</em></p>
<p>While updating your sketch recently, I replaced the legacy AF logic with that from Mk2i rev5d which forms part of my standard multi-load control mechanism.&nbsp; This newer algorithm does not have twin energy thresholds; instead, it uses just one threshold (the mid-point of the energy bucket) plus its knowledge about the passing of time.&nbsp;&nbsp; IMHO, there are some key benefits to this approach, one of which is that the system no longer requires accurate calibration.&nbsp; The reason for this is that time, unlike energy flow, is already known in absolute terms.</p>
<p>Another advantage of this system is that it works particularly well for smaller loads such as your bank of 1 kW battery chargers.&nbsp; This is because more time is available when deciding whether a given load will suffice, or whether an additional load needs to be added or removed.&nbsp; With the original 2-threshold system, nothing happens until one of the thresholds is reached, then decisions need to be made very quickly.&nbsp; This benefit of the newer algorithm is greatest with smaller loads.&nbsp; When cycling large (3kW) loads, the two systems having exactly the same timing limitations.</p>

     <p>We all enjoyed some fun discussing this sort of thing <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/2006">here</a> last year.</p>
<p>Clearly storing surplus PV energy is proving very successful when heating water for later domestic use. The big advantage in doing this is that we are using existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>A more radical idea might be to design a very high temperature heat storage device like an old fashioned brick bread oven but using modern highly efficient insulating materials. So when you want to cook that pizza just open the door and pop it in. No need to switch it on.</p>
<p>It would bring back the need for skill in cooking - no gas mark 6 simplicity here!</p>

     <p>The beauty of using water to store the heat is there is nothing better in terms the quantity of heat in a given volume and convenience. Most of the time it is easy to handle and you can use the heat without needing to transfer it to something else.</p>
<p>Hydrogen has a rather higher Specific Heat Capacity but it needs a large volume to get the same weight and it can be <a href="http://media.nj.com/star-ledger/photo/2012/05/10965711-standard.jpg">unforgiving if you handle it wrongly.</a>&nbsp; Helium is a little less bad but still hardly convenient.</p>

     <p>Bill, you are correct, I was referring to the Tesla Powerwall, If I could only buy them in bulk. They have limited availability unless you were able to pre-buy a unit. I mentioned the Aquion battery because it looks very interesting compared to lead-acid or lithium-ion. Aquion is local to me so I am hoping to pay them a visit. I have a tremendous need to divert energy to batteries or water heating loads due to changes in the net-metering policies where I do business.</p>

     <p>I&#39;d love to have a few of their 10 kWh units myself! I&#39;m hoping they get their plant built on time, and are able to ramp up production quickly. Maybe they&#39;ll drop in price once Tesla sells enough of them to recover the R&amp;D costs.</p>

     <p>Hi all, new to the forum, I am an active contributor on various ev forums I am registered on.</p>
<p>My position is coming from a lithium battery view. I have been using lifepo4 lithium for about 2 years in a Toyota Prius&nbsp;that I converted into a plug in Prius by fitting in controls systems and a 7.5 kWh lifepo4 battery.</p>
<p>there is no charge curve or profile charge requirements for lifepo4 lithium, just charge at constant current until the charger output voltage matches the battery pack voltage, at this point no current flows and the battery is full.</p>
<p>in practice though, I run my packs alittle lower in total pack voltage, I also allow at least 10% capacity at full and low charge limits only using at the most 80% of the battery capacity, this will prolong the battery life. I have run my plug in Prius and covered about 10000 miles mostly in ev mode and seen very little to no degradation in the battery capacity.</p>
<p>so, could this be termed a standard load, as there is no special charging requirement? ( for lithium only)</p>
<p>also, in relation to batteries, Nissan Leaf vehicles are starting to show up in salvage yards, they are sought after by ev enthusiasts but I&#39;m sure a steady stream of supply will be available within a couple of years, these batteries at 24kwh&nbsp;capacity (I&#39;d only use 20kwh max though to extend life) are great for projects with energy storage. I managed to pick up a battery myself 2 moths ago, 16kwh&nbsp;is now in use in my Prius, the other 8kwh&nbsp;and the&nbsp;older Prius 7.5kwh&nbsp; lifepo4 is going to make up my battery store for energy storage.</p>
<p>I&#39;m Looking for a pv excess diverted to divert excess pv electricity into heat store then battery store plus the plug in Prius, more complicated than a standard set up but I&#39;m sure is a do able project</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks. Anthony.</p>
