                <h3 class="title" style="">Feeding a Maplin weather station into Emoncms</h3>
        <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/emon/user/3862" title="View user profile.">GJPickard</a> on Sun, 23/02/2014 - 16:42</span>
        <div class="content"><p>With a lot of help from many websites I am pleased to say that I have managed to set up a remote moteino based node to listen out for the data from a Maplin weather station (a N96Gy using OOK encoding at 433 MHz) and then to push it back out in a Jeelab/emonCMS friendly format.</p>
<p>A bit of background</p>
<p>A while back I bought a Raspberry Pi and after firing it up a few times it went back on the shelf needing a project.&nbsp; Roll forwards a couple of months and I came across Kevin Sangeelee&#39;s project for intercepting the data from a cheap Maplin weather station (their N96GY) and feeding it into a RPi <a href="http://www.susa.net" title="www.susa.net">www.susa.net</a>.</p>
<p>So when I next saw the weather station on offer I bought one and with the help of the excellent Pywws software and <a href="http://www.weather.dragontail.co.uk&#039;s" title="www.weather.dragontail.co.uk&#039;s">www.weather.dragontail.co.uk&#039;s</a> RPi image and How To guides I now have my own little weather site.</p>
<p>With one project in hand and working it was time to branch out (and thankfully it is really hard to break a RPi).&nbsp; I then came across a bunch of home monitoring websites and this appealed to the inner geek.</p>
<p>A few months later and the house is slowly getting wired up with sensor nodes based on moteinos from lowpowerlab.com and a couple of Funkyv2s from harizanov.com.&nbsp; Nobody warned me I would need to start learning to code!</p>
<p>The inevitable</p>
<p>So there I was running a couple RPis:&nbsp; one with Pywws grabbing the weather data; and the second grabbing sensor data and pushing it into emonCMS.&nbsp; I know it is only a matter of time before I lose a SD card on one of these so getting the weather data into emonCMS as a form of backup would make sense &ndash; as Murphy&#39;s law dictates this will be just before I do a backup of the SD card.&nbsp; Making this happen was not quite as easy.</p>
<p>There are a few tantalising threads out there about pushing data from Pywws into emonCMS, however,&nbsp; as my html and Java is non-existent I needed a bit more than a few hints.&nbsp; I also have an issue with my Pywws as it looks like it is stuck on an older Raspbian image as any update hopelessly breaks the wifi and it was a real pain to set up in the first instance.&nbsp; So scratch messing with the Pywws RPi until I have time for a full rebuild (and trying to remember how I did it the first time around).</p>
<p>The solution</p>
<p>So how was I to get the weather station info into emonCMS?&nbsp; So off I went to trawl through the many blog posts and forums looking at grabbing data off weather stations.&nbsp; Thankfully the Maplin is a re-badge of the Fine Offset WH1080 which has had a lot of work put into it.&nbsp; Once I worked out that I had one of the older versions using OOK encoding at 433mHz that finally lead me to Mark and Andrew at <a href="http://www.homeautomationhub.com" title="www.homeautomationhub.com">www.homeautomationhub.com</a> - a really interesting project itself - and to Jeelab for the vital hardware mods needed.&nbsp; If you have a 868 mHz unit or one of the newer FSK versions you should find plenty of info there as well.</p>
<p>As I am using a RFM12Pi to receive the other sensor data that meant the GPIO ports were taken up.&nbsp; I also did not want to break the emonCMS RPi.</p>
<p>As I had every prospect of making a mess of the soldering (0603 really are small) I decided to use a little break out board care of nathan.chantrell.net for the RFM12B and made a shield on a small through-hole protoboard to mount this on - not pretty but cheap and functional (photo attached).&nbsp; Into this I am plugging a bare moteino as, with this running at 3.3v, this saves me having to deal with level shifting for the RFM12B.&nbsp; If you want to use a 5v Arduino the Jeelabs breakout looks to be a good option.</p>
<p>One crash course later in teaching myself just enough C# to be dangerous I seem to have a stable node listening out for the N96GY, grabbing the data and kicking it back out to emonCMS.</p>
<p>A big thank you to everyone out there that made this possible and the code in all its gory detail is attached.&nbsp; This looks to be working fine on a moteino but it does use up quite a lot of space if you turn on all the debugging options.</p>
<p>I am currently sleeping the node for a couple of minutes and then waking up to find a signal (they should be coming in every 48 seconds) and then it is back to sleep for a couple of minutes again. Any suggestions for some more power saving options appreciated as I am sure I can probably switch off a few 328 features I am not using.</p>
<p>What next?</p>
<p>Adding some more power save options<br />
	Using a voltage divider for a better battery reading than using the internal voltage<br />
	Messing around in emonCMS to do something with the data</p>
<p>Happy to answer any questions but please bear in mind that I am not a programmer and the decoding code is not of my creation.</p>

     <p>I&#39;ve done something similar but running pywws&nbsp;installed on a emoncms HDD image on a pi and using the pywws &#39;service&#39; facility to push the data via a json call with API. Works flawlessly! &nbsp;Had to write the service template for pywws but that was easy. &nbsp;Search the pywws&nbsp;google group for info. &nbsp;I put the files on github.</p>
