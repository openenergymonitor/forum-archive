        <div class="content"><p>I have been monitoring my solar generation and consumption using a setup I created myself which reads an Elster&nbsp;A100C&nbsp;generation meter and my L&amp;G Import Meter together with a clamp meter for Total Consumption.</p>
<p><a href="http://simonshome.dyndns.tv:999/">http://simonshome.dyndns.tv:999</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I &nbsp;currently have a combi boiler and my summer gas consumption is mostly Hot Water. I am thinking of getting a 300L Hot water tank. I want to divert my excess solar energy to the water tank and have seen some sample projects to do this.</p>
<p>Many of them use a Triac circuit to turn the power as different time delays during the phase to regulate the power. I was wondering if it would be possible to use a zero cross SSR&nbsp;and just fire it for so many half cycles in each second. So If I have 1KW&nbsp;of spare energy and I have a 2KW immersion heater I could fire the SSR once every other half cycle and draw 1KW. If I build in a 10% safety&nbsp;margin and only fire it 45 of the 100 half cycles per second &nbsp;this should use up most of my spare consumption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I was wondering Is how sensitive are the meters I have a standard&nbsp;Ampy/L&amp;G how many jewels have to flow forward before they register. According to the spec the start current is 0.4% of the BASE current which on my meter is 20A ie&nbsp;80mA&nbsp;(Approximately&nbsp;20W).</p>
<p>The meter binks&nbsp;once per W/H IE once for every 3600 jewels. If I have an excess of 1KW&nbsp;or power I have 1000 j/s going out through the meter which is 10 jewels every half phase. &nbsp;My Immersion heater would draw 20 J per half phase (2000J/S/100th&nbsp;of a S) .</p>
<p>So does the meter count upto&nbsp;3600 J before if registers a W/H unit? From what I gather they subtract outflow IE if you had a reactive load that say drew 3KW for half the phase and returned 500W&nbsp;for the other half it would measure 2.5kW on the meter.</p>
<p>If the minimum measured unit is 3600J&nbsp;(1WH) then it should be posbible to turn the heater on for a second then off for a second. As in the first second its on would have an inflow of 1000J&nbsp;(2000W&nbsp; (Load) -1000W(Generation) ) the register would then be zeroed&nbsp;by the outflow of 1000J&nbsp;of generation.</p>
<p>So what I was wondering was does anyone know how many Joules there is the minimum measures amount for a standard electricity meter?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately I suppose the meter could just add up all the total outbound energies per half phase or phase if it were per phase I could rectify the supply to give an alternative of 1Kw or 2Kw&nbsp;dump load?&nbsp;</p>

     <p>I&#39;ve recently been looking at all of the core chips used in the electronic energy meters.&nbsp; All of the chips are capable of resolving to energy levels of less than 1Wh, but the meter manufacturers seem to vary in their implementation.&nbsp; Some stick to the same sort of energy resolution that was an inherent feature of the magnetic drag &quot;anti-creep&quot; feature built in to induction disc type meters.&nbsp; This is typically about 1 Wh (3600 J).</p>
<p>The advent of electronic meters has allowed far better resolution, with lower thresholds, but many manufacturers stick to 1Wh as the threshold.&nbsp; I know of one that has a 1250 J threshold, though, so it is possible that energy threshold figures will reduce as meter manufacturers decide that lower thresholds can still give reliable operation.</p>
<p>As a typical immersion is rated at 3000W, a single cycle will be 60 J, so there is plenty of scope for fine control of power to an immersion heater, even using zero crossing control.</p>

     <p>I think you need to read the articles on <a href="https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/?redirect=meters" title="Energy Meters">Energy Meters</a> and <a href="../mk2.html" title="Diverting surplus PV Power, by Robin Emley">Diverting surplus PV Power</a></p>
<p>You cannot use a half wave rectifier to control the power into your load. A half-wave rectifier generates a large proportion of even harmonic current in the supply that is guaranteed to exceed the permissible limits here in the UK, and most probably elsewhere in the world too.</p>

     <p>The tank I have my eye on has a 2KW&nbsp;immersion heater in it as I only ever have a maximum 2.6KW excess. They do have one with two 2KW heaters I did contemplate this one as I could use SSRs to switch one one or both in series this &nbsp; would give me the option of 1K or 2KW. If I can find one with 2 *&nbsp;1KW&nbsp;heaters I could swich&nbsp;two on 2kw 1 on 1 kw or both in series 500w&nbsp;that would probably be enough variation for me. &nbsp;</p>

     <p>It&#39;s straightforward enough to use a single SSR to vary power to the immersion in single cycle increments, but to get acceptable flicker performance (caused by small voltage drops) it&#39;s necessary to do some jiggery pokery to either psuedo-randomise the &quot;on&quot; pulses over several cycles, or accumulate them and concatenate all the &quot;ons&quot; into a single, sub-detection threshold, pulse.</p>
<p>There&#39;s no real need for lower power immersion heater elements, as power can be controlled pretty much irrespective of the element rating (subject to the max being the rating).</p>

     <p>I think you&#39;ll find that all the basic problems have been already sorted out.&nbsp; If you can provide a load that&#39;s sufficient to mop up all your surplus power, then you can feel confident that a Mk2 PV Router will be able to control it in a way that is effective and reliable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All Mk2 variants will heat water in a similar manner, but you may prefer one version than another depending on what else you want to do.&nbsp; The code for the original version was rather bulky.&nbsp; It includes a &quot;debug&quot; mode which was useful for me at the time but has generally not found much favour.&nbsp; A trimmed down version of the original code, still with floating-point maths, is available as Mk2_PV_Router_mini_3.</p>
<p>Mk2a versions uses integer maths and are very much faster.&nbsp;&nbsp; Mk2i versions are interrupt-based, and are faster again.&nbsp; The Mk2i_rev5a version can support multiple loads, one of which can be controlled via an RF link.&nbsp; All of these versions, along with various tools and videos etc. can be found <a href="1757.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>Equivalent solutions have also been posted by other designers.&nbsp; As far as I&#39;m aware, the only difference is the way that the flow of energy at the supply point is determined.&nbsp; The &quot;energy bucket&quot; stage, and the means by which its level is regulated by varying the power to the load, seems to be pretty much standard.</p>
