        <div class="content"><p>On a previous project I worked on, we had a small micro sampling data in an interrupt routine, and then processing and sending the data once a certain condition was met in the main program loop, all the while still sampling data via that interrupt. &nbsp;We were fairly short on processor power, so the interrupt had to be fairly optimized, as did the calculation code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone considered that sort of setup here? &nbsp;Are there any obvious reasons not to do it that way, such as for instance the&nbsp;Arduino not having the processing power to handle it?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think the added accuracy is that terribly important, but I did notice that when I changed my sampling delay from 1 s to 2 s I started missing the startup current surge from my fridge more frequently. &nbsp;Not a big deal, but seeing that surge makes it easier to identify the fridge as the culprit, as opposed to a light left on somewhere in the house.</p>
<p>Just wondering if anyone has ruled this out already. &nbsp;</p>

     <p>I've been looking into this a bit. Looking at the hardware spec, it should be possible to do full three-phase current and voltage measurements using a single emonTX. One would need to sample first and calculate later, i.e.</p>
<p>1) sample a couple of wavelengths<br />
2) do the calculations over the complete data set<br />
3) send the calculated data<br />
4) sleep<br />
5) repeat</p>
<p>in contrast to today's:</p>
<p>1) take one sample and calculate<br />
2) repeat for 20 half-waves<br />
3) send the calculated data<br />
4) sleep<br />
5) repeat</p>
<p>To sample 3-phase, I &amp; U, two whole 50 Hz wavelengths at 1.5 kHz:</p>
<p>* total sampling frequency = 6 channels * 1500 Hz = 9 kHz<br />
* total storage = 2/50 (sampling time) * 1500 (freq) * 6 (channels) * 2 (bytes/sample) = 720 bytes</p>
<p>9 kHz sampling rate is possible while retaining the full 10 bit resolution. The chip's got 2 kB of RAM, so depending on other memory usage, it should be enough (I haven't investigated this yet).</p>
<p>Also, it should be possible to compensate for voltage phase shift by simply shifting the sampling of the voltage in time instead of the PHASECAL calculation done in EmonLib today.</p>

<p>The reason for measuring a short period then sleeping is to extend the operating period when battery powered. If mains powered, that is obviously not a concern.</p>

     <p>Great! Thanks for the link!</p>
<p>I did some thinking and realised that even at 4.5 kHz sample rate, one sample period is 4 degrees phase shift at 50 Hz. So using that kind of shift instead of the PHASECAL calculation won&#39;t do.</p>
<p>The reason I looked at interrupt driven sampling (or rather free-running sampling) was that I saw that the HW should be able to handle three-phase current+voltage measurements, and it seemed a bit excessive to use three emonTXs for that then. I thought it was simply not possible to sample often enough when doing calculations in-between each sample.</p>
<p>But since the emonTX is sleeping most of the time anyway, one could just sample current+voltage for one phase at a time. It should just be a matter of adding the needed voltage input circuitry.</p>
<p>It looks like you manage about 5 kHz sample rate in <a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emonTxFirmware/blob/master/emonTx_CT123_3Phase_Voltage/emonTx_CT123_3Phase_Voltage.ino">Robert&#39;s 3-phase code</a>: sample delay for L3 is 17 samples = two phase-to-phase periods; 17*3/2 would be # of samples for a complete cycle, and x4 since you sample three currents and one voltage = 102 samples/cycle, or 5100 per second. Free-running sampling could raise this to some 9 kHz, which perhaps would increase the accuracy (?), but it doesn&#39;t make a difference as to how many phases one can sample. More phases just mean less sleep (and more power draw).</p>

     <p>The main problem with using a single voltage measurement for a 3-phase system is that the voltages can vary quite significantly from phase to phase. I regularly see 10V between phases in my house. This will be an unknown error if you only monitor a single phase.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think there is an issue time wise</p>

     <p>Yes, just like you did in <a href="1170.html">your (beautiful!) setup</a>, I&#39;d like to measure the voltage of each phase too. And what I&#39;m trying to say (in my own convoluted way ;) is that this can be done with a single emonTX, if one just adds the circuitry for two additional voltage inputs.</p>
<p>Using interrupt-driven sampling one could additionally increase the number of samples per phase and 50 Hz cycle to ~90, from today&#39;s ~50. Which may not matter much...</p>
<p>I&#39;m just waiting for the USB-to-serial programmer to be in stock again so that I can order my emonTX and start coding. :)</p>

     <p>You&#39;re right of course, it&#39;s straight forward to add the extra circuitry for more inputs on a breadboard but with emonTx PCBs only costing &pound;5 it would make sense to use those just for the time it would save wiring the breadboard.&nbsp;When you get to that point you have to consider that an ATMega chip is also only &pound;5, and you get 3 times the processing power - that was my train of thought anyway. The stackability of emonTx boards makes things so easy. I don&#39;t know if this was a design feature or pure luck but either way it was a stroke of genius by Glyn and Trystan.</p>
<p>I&#39;m running interrupt based code of my system. It&#39;s a 3-phase version of the code I posted here: <a href="1535.html">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/1535</a></p>
<p>A normal ADC conversion takes about 120us so if you&#39;re doing 4 per sample that&#39;s a minimum of 480us for each sample, or 41 per mains cycle. You can speed up the conversion time by changing the ADC clock. I double it in my code above so each conversion takes about 60us.</p>
<p>Thanks for the compliment on my system BTW, it&#39;s grown a bit now with 3 power controllers. I&#39;ll post some more pictures soon.</p>
