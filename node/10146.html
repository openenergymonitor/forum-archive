        <div class="content"><p>Hello all,&nbsp;I installed a new hot water system over the weekend which has a pair of temp monitoring ports. &nbsp;Keen to see what it was doing I grabbed one of the four new emontx3.4&#39;s I have here waiting to go into my work and do 3 phase monitoring to log the temps temporarily. &nbsp;I modified emonTxV3_4_RFM12B_DiscreteSampling so it would output the two&nbsp;DS18B20 sensors and powered the emon&nbsp;from 3 x AA batteries. &nbsp;It took me about 30 mins back and forth&nbsp;to get my code working,&nbsp;but once it was ready to go I noticed when I powered&nbsp;up the emon&nbsp;the&nbsp;red LED would simply stay on and not proceed past the POST phase in the debugging output. &nbsp;Thinking it may have been a problem with my code, I reloaded the original code and tried that with the same result. &nbsp;As it was late and I wanted to head to bed, I grabbed&nbsp;another emontx3.4 I had here, loaded in my&nbsp;modified code for the multiple temp inputs and&nbsp;it worked. &nbsp;Sweet, the other one&#39;s a problem for the morning I thought.</p>
<p>Well it worked for about 5 hours and then stopped transmitting. &nbsp;I hit reset on the unit and it hung at the red LED post sequence again. &nbsp;I did some debugging&nbsp;and it locks up at the rf12_initialize line. &nbsp;On closer inspection of my RFM12B module I noticed a pair of smt capacitors had literally blown off the board. &nbsp;I then had a look at the other one which died last night and it had the same caps failed in the same manner.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t looked over the schematics yet but I&#39;m at a loss as to how this could happen. &nbsp;The only thing which *might* be relevant is when programming the board I left the batteries in when I plugged in the UART module. &nbsp;I&#39;ve plugged in my 3rd unit and changed JP2 to open just in case that had anything to do with it which I doubt.</p>
<p>Any ideas? &nbsp;I&#39;ve had a pair for emontx3.2&#39;s in service for months running 4 temp inputs with the code modified in the same manner&nbsp;without a single issue so I&#39;m at a bit of a loss as to why these ones have failed. &nbsp;The&nbsp;pic&nbsp;attached tells the story...</p>

     <p>Hi Glyn,</p>
<p>I can understand striking an odd fault like this with&nbsp;one unit,&nbsp;but two? &nbsp;Possibly a component issue for the batch perhaps. &nbsp;Good news is the 3rd one which I installed this morning has been running without fault for over 12 hours now, the only thing I did different with this one was open JP2 which I can&#39;t see having any effect.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve just taken a measurement of the 3.3v and 5v rails on both of the failed units:</p>
<pre>
Rail 3.3v   /   5.0v
======================
#1   3.30v  /   5.01v
#2   3.28v  /   5.00v
</pre><p>I also took a voltage measurement across what&#39;s left of the pads on the two failed units. &nbsp;I read 3.3v across the pads where the rightmost capacitor on each one should be and 0v across the pads for the leftmost&nbsp;cap. &nbsp;These voltages are identical whether the unit is being powered by battery, the&nbsp;TTL to&nbsp;UART&nbsp;adaptor or with both connected at once. &nbsp;In addition to this, I also performed these tests with 2 x DS18B20&nbsp;probes connected to be sure I was replicating the scenario under which the fault occurred with no change in observed voltages.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t understand the cause of the failure based on the fact the voltages are in check, I&#39;m pretty sure those SMT caps aren&#39;t polarized...</p>
<p>Given how cost prohibitive is is for us to ship aboard here in Australia (we get royally reamed)&nbsp;I would be happy to order the correct SMT components from Farnell/element14 and replace them myself if that&#39;s an option. &nbsp;If it is, could you please advise what values they are? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

     <p>I&#39;m not sure how this could have happened, it could possibly be a physical issue where the capacitors have got knocked in transit. I&#39;m not what the values of the capacitors are, one of the is 4.7nF according to this post&nbsp;http://jeelabs.org/2011/01/27/ook-reception-with-rfm12b-2/</p>
<p><span style="font-size:13px; line-height:1.6">How about initially I try sending you four capacitors salvaged from faulty units here in the lab to see if this fixes the problem?&nbsp;</span></p>

     <p>Hmm - that is catastrophic module abuse ! &nbsp;Scrap them - most unlikely only the caps were affected - they are caps, only accidentally surge protection diodes!.</p>
<p>To blow an SMD cap off like that, there was a major energy pulse on Vcc and/or GND.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest you review how this could have happened - it looks like a &quot;mains&quot; event to me....</p>

     <p>Glyn&nbsp;- I&#39;ll create a support ticket now, I can imagine trying to manage support via the forum would be a nightmare, hence the reason&nbsp;you put systems in place like Zendesk :) &nbsp;-- I&#39;m happy to fit those caps, when you send them please label them accordingly!</p>
<p>Emjay - these particular emon&#39;s have never been powered from an AC adaptor (yet), they were brand new out of the box, then&nbsp;only connected to the USB to UART&nbsp;adaptor for programming, then powered from 3 x AAA batteries (I didn&#39;t have any AA&#39;s handy at the time). &nbsp;When I saw the damage I was at a loss as to how it could have possibly happened with such meager power supplies! &nbsp;If I get the opportunity I&#39;ll borrow my macro lens back from my friend&nbsp;and take a *real* photo. &nbsp;There&#39;s none of the usual &quot;let the magic smoke out&quot; artifacts around the components, the damage looks physical yet I can&#39;t see how it could have happened as they were purchased as assembled units inside the extruded case. &nbsp;They were&nbsp;opened for inserting batteries and connecting the temp senders and reassembled. &nbsp;On close inspection the remainder of both boards are perfect; I&#39;m at a loss as to how it could have happened.</p>
