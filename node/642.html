        <div class="content"><p>Recently we have been thinking about what changes and new features would be good to have in the new version of the emonTx.</p>
<p>The general idea is that the next version will be pre-assembled with SMT electronics, we plan to keep the current features such:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arduino compatible Atmega 328 running at 3.3V&nbsp;</li>
<li>RFM12B wireless</li>
<li>3 x CT channels</li>
<li>Pulse counting - digital I/O</li>
<li>low power</li>
</ul>
<p>New features we are considering adding are:</p>
<p><strong>Wireless:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Xbee socket option, could also be used for<a href="http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/roving-network-rn-xv-xbee-shaped-wifi-module-xmas-price/"> WiFly Rover networks wifi module</a>&nbsp;or<a href="http://shop.ciseco.co.uk/xrf-wireless-rf-radio-uart-rs232-serial-data-module-xbee-shape-arduino-pic-etc/"> XRF</a> for extra range&ndash; RFM12B will still be the default wireless option.</li>
<li>Option to use SMA&nbsp;antenna&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sensor connections:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal blocks for connecting eight DS18B20 temperature sensors - horizontal insertion?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Indication &amp; buttons:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Tri-colour indicator LED &ndash; green = good, red = bad (low battery etc..)</li>
<li>Push button to be configured for pairing</li>
<li>Reset button?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Power</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>3.7V Lipo battery compatibility &ndash; with USB charging (MAX1555&nbsp;/&nbsp;MCP73833 or&nbsp;<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif; text-align: -webkit-left; ">MCP73871&nbsp;</span>control IC?) <a href="http://jeelabs.org/2010/05/29/using-lipo-batteries/">JeeNode&nbsp;example</a>, <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/259">adafruit example</a></li>

<li>Option to fix 2xAA battery holder onto rear of PCB</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Casing</strong></p>
<p>Size the PCB to slide into an aluminum&nbsp;case such as the one below. An acrylic/ply-wood fascia can then easily be laser cut the accommodate the ports.

     <p>My opinion is that remote sensors must be as cheap as possible and the fancy staff will be at the internet-connected module - a Raspberry Pi for example. The WiFi or Zigbee stuff is good, but pricey and I personally wouldn&#39;t use it. I&#39;d love to see dedicated micro sensors (attiny series) all around the house reporting things to the Raspberry Pi. Hopefully, there will be a LAMP port for it one day and it may host emoncms as well, so no need to have external hosting.</p>

     <p>Yeah I agree, the idea we have is to add an Xbee holder onto the board but by default this would be un-populated, RFM12B is the cheapest option. We are trying to make the hardware as flexible and future proof as possible.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Could you use the case as an aerial? Or is that a crazy idea as im finding the range of the current RF to be VERY small. Eg&nbsp;through 1 wall only.</p>
<p>Humidity sounds like a great idea although it may have to be a remote sensor not built on this maybe better suited to the GLCD. The DHTXX are worth a look at, iv got a couple im using to monitor inside and outside.</p>
<p>Gas meters. Could this be done. If were trying to monitor our energy consuption&nbsp;gas should be a part (although this may be a problem with regs)</p>

     <p>Here is what I think is the future for remote sensors, here is one temperature sender using ATTiny85&#39;s internal temperature sensor and RFM12B on the bottom; The PCB and schematic seem different from the end product but the idea is nice, coin cell sized battery operated remote sensor. Give that I2C connectivity (supported by Attiny84) and it is irresistible&nbsp;</p>

     <p>1 extra CT-sensor would be great, you could use, 3 for mains consumption (one per fase) and one for a PV system. An rs232/485 port for communication with an invertor&nbsp;would be a big plus. The tri-color led is a good feature to expand the feedback possibilities om the print.</p>

     <p>Thank you for all the ideas. Sorry for the delay in posting, Trystan and I have been travelling this last week. We now have stable internet, normal operation is resumed!</p>
<p><strong>Case and antenna:</strong><br />
	The idea is that we external SMA whip antenna would be used with the aluminium case. Such as <a href="http://cpc.farnell.com/jsp/level5/module.jsp?moduleId=cpc/407338.xml">http://cpc.farnell.com/jsp/level5/module.jsp?moduleId=cpc/407338.xml</a>, that way the case won&#39;t effect the signal. I think the range could be improved be using a whip antenna since it&#39;s RF output is helical not as much RF power is lost upwards and downwards. We have had a bit of a debate going regarding the embodied energy in Aluminium, I did a blog post on this last night: <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.com/2012/05/embodied-energy-of-electronic-enclosure.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.com/2012/05/embodied-energy-of-electronic-enclosure.html</a></p>
<p><strong>Sensors:</strong><br />
	Humidity sensors are interesting, I have experimented using the DHT11 humidity sensor, this sensor requires 3-5V and a single data line pulled high with a 5K resistor. It wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to wire in the sensor either into a JeePort or the pulse counting I/O. I&#39;m not sure if humidity is important enough to merit it&#39;s own dedicated port on the emonTx.</p>
<p><strong>Form factor:</strong><br />
	I like the idea of lots of low power, small and cheap sensors such as the design posted by mharizanov. This form factor would be ideal for a distributed wireless temperature network. The emonTx however will need to larger to accommodate the number of I/O ports required.</p>
<p><strong>Burden Resistor:</strong><br />
	Great idea posted by prensel regarding having an interchangeable burden resistor for different CT&#39;s and measurement ranges. I think the best compromise is to have an SMT burden resistor and include the holes and pads to solder in a thru-hole burden resistor and de-solder the SMT if required.</p>
<p><strong>Number of CT channels:</strong><br />
	I think three is a good number, we haven&rsquo;t really needed extra channels, the limiting factor is board space for any extra 3.5mm jacks, more channels would also increase the cost and probably only be utilised by a few users. If more channels are required it&#39;s quite easy to have multiple emonTx&#39;s on the same network. If there is free space I&#39;ll see if it&#39;s possible to squeeze one extra channel on.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>It would also be great to breakout two or three digital outputs (with PWM) on the side of emonTx board to screw terminals. I know the firmware does not allow it now, but we could add code in the future that makes it possible to control external relays mounted in the electrical box.</p>

     <p>I fancy the optional wireless header &amp; Ethernet suggestion :)</p>
<p>But this kind of imposes equivalent upgrades to the emonBase and emonGLCD, right?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For power I&#39;m planning on using Seeed Studio&#39;s Lipo Rider Pro, while there is no integrated solution. If you want, I can perform some tests to verify any impact resulting from interference caused by the DC-DC boost converter. However I don&#39;t predict any visible impact, since we already power our emon devices with switched-mode power supplies. Unless the proximity of such circuitry could have a different impact.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four CT channels would be awesome, but please clarify, were these CT channels designed to separate energy consumption by type, rather than by phase? i.e. lighting / heating / devices within the *same* phase</p>
<p>I&#39;m concerned as to how I can measure power usage on 3 distinct phases accurately, when we only have one AC input from the AC-AC transformer (Each phase has its own fluctuating voltage. Is my assumption correct?). And if space is a concern for an extra CT connector, I can&#39;t begin to imagine if we talked about extra AC inputs. But then again, I don&#39;t have three outlets installed next to each other and each with a different phase; maybe one needs to place the outlets right in the electrical board, and plug the transformers there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m building the current version of emonTx very soon, it&#39;s probably best that I avoid further commenting before I spend some time with it ;)</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Yes, in the ideal world where everything is perfectly balanced, all three phase voltages would be the same. But in the real world you are correct, different loads on different phases will cause the three line voltages and the neutral voltage to move relative to each other and to earth.</p>

<p>I imagine few people do. I would have concerns over safety in a domestic environment with up to 440 V between any two lines.</p>

     <p>To accurately measure voltage, current, real and apparent power on each of 3 phases you need to have 3 voltage inputs and 3 current inputs, therefore 3 voltage adapters and 3 CTs.</p>
<p>The EmonTx does not have the necessary 3 voltage inputs. But two analogue inputs are not used - ADC 4 on pin 27 and ADC5 on pin 28, I think it would be possible for you to repeat the circuit components that measure voltage (R11, R12, R13, R14, C10) two times on an external board and connect to these pins.&nbsp; I have to tried to do this, so I do not know whether it would work.</p>
<p>[Edit]</p>
<p>I modified a copy of EmonLib and wrote a test sketch to measure the voltages on ADC4 and ADC5 - these are available as SDA and SCK on the PWR/SER/I2C header on the EmonTx board. To test, I placed a jumper wire between P3 - AIO2 (the voltage input) and SDA or SCK, and I read the correct voltage. So I think it will work.</p>

     <p>You will of course need to make a copy of EmonLib and edit it to (a) add the correct input pins for the new voltage inputs and (b) pair them with the correct CT to calculate the powers, possibly each with its own calibration factor and phase angle correction.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;The ultimate emonTx would have headers for an ethernet module, digital programmable outputs (screw terminals) but also something very important: I think there should be the possibility to connect up to 3 emonTx slaves to an emonTx master that would have ethernet connectivity.</p>
<p>This is the case for example when you have a massive circuits breakers board and you want to install more than 4 CTs, then one emonTx would have Ethernet (or maybe RFM12B), one AC voltage sensor, and would be connected over I2C to 1, 2 or 3 other emonTx's. The master would measure Vrms, 4CT's and communicate the Vrms value over I2C to slaves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slaves would have up to 4 CT's connected to them, no connectivity options other than the I2C communication with the master. This would take only two pins and one resistor.</p>
<p>Five connections must be made between the master and the slaves: SCL, SDA, GND, Vin and reset. I can imagine that a normal RJ 45 connector would be suitable.</p>
<p>With this we can have a very modular system that is also suitable for bigger installations</p>

     <p>Hi, first post on the forum. I have been following your project for some time as I am searching for a good way to monitor my total energy use and production (PV panels on the roof). So far I have not yet found the perfect solution, so may I add some ideas for the next emonTx.</p>
<p><strong>Additional pulse inputs</strong><br />
This would be great to measure all energy use. At least in the Netherlands we have a sort of 'E-closet' where electricity, gas and water enters the home. The last 2 can best be measured using pulse sensors. Additionally a pulse input could be used to differ between high and low electricity tariff, if applicable for some people (including myself).</p>
<p>So in short: 3 pulse inputs would be well appreciated</p>
<p><strong>Offline local storage<br />
</strong>Using a SD-card on the emonTx would give the opportunity to store the data locally, have it run fully autonomously, and retrieve data later. Possible setup could be like making data-files for each day, read those files on a local networked computer once a week and input that in a database. So no live view (which can be retained using the RFM12B anyway), but data-processing later.</p>
<p><strong>Retain 1 open Jeeport</strong><br />
Jeelabs has wonderfull extension plugs available. If you could leave one Jeeport open, people can extend the emonTx with these plugs as required.</p>
<p>So far for my ideas. Any comments are appreciated.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;Hey people,</p>
<p>I needed an SMD version of emonTx, but with an ATMega 328, arduino shields compatibility and 4 CT's, so the new A32u4 based emonTx doesn't suit my needs.</p>
<p>This is my attempt to make an SMD emonTX with my above requirements (see attached schematics and board). I still need to include a master-slave method to interconnect several emonTx's, but I alreay had a hard time routing this board. It is more like an exercice to get a working SMD microcontroller design. All credit goes to the Arduino team, Trystan, Glyn and JCW of Jeelabs.</p>
<p>My final board will probably have a different layout and a master-slave bus.</p>

<p>I also had my doubts about that, even though the datasheet says it can supply up to 200mA. I'll get one pcb made and test it, then maybe I'll have to choose another regulator or another resistor.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, so you think another package than 0603 is more suitable for that resistor?</p>

     <p>The original value of R5 56 Ohms was calculated for the Emontx power consumption without the extra 100mA of the WIZ820. Since the input is AC, C5 has to deliver the consumed current for roughly one periode means 20ms, until it is recharged again. The values for C5, R5 have to be recalculated for the much higher consumption with the WIZ820 module. This also depends on the voltage of the wall transformer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Question is if the distortion of the input voltage is still within acceptable limits then. Perhaps Glyn could test this with his LTSpice simulation.</p>
<p>For the MCP1703 you could choose the SOT223 package which has a much lower thermal resistance and try to dump as much heat as possible into the GND plane.</p>

     <p>&nbsp;Hello Joerg,</p>
<p>your guess was right! Even with an R5 value of 10R and a C5 of 470uF the MCP 1702 (that's what I'm using, but I didn't have the corrsponding eagle part), this power supply can not provide more than 126mA, which is too little.I noticed that the waveform distortion is not that important (very negligeable actually) even with a 126mA load. I have doubts that this is wrong.</p>
<p>I think a full wave rectifier design is necessary to power the extra modules (ethernet, etc), I'll do some reading and try to come up with an acceptable design.</p>
<p>I will share it here on the forum, or on a new topic. All help is appreciated, since I didn't do this before.</p>

<p>You cannot go to a full-wave rectifier without one of:</p>
<ol>
<li>A centre-tapped transformer,</li>
<li>Another isolating transformer,</li>
<li>An isolating op-amp.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you try to use a single winding transformer and a bridge rectifier, one way or another you end up shorting part of the bridge. (That's what Mark Beal's circuit, that was picked up and promoted elsewhere, did, with as a consequence a voltage wave that bore little resemblance to what came out of the power station!).</p>
<p>The whole purpose of the single supply was to remove the need for those things and the separate 5 V supply. If you want to have a high-powered radio or Ethernet, or multiple temperature sensors, then the single supply is simply not appropriate and was never intended for that purpose.</p>

     <p>Amin,</p>
<p>the LF33 is a good choice although with a much higher quiescent current than the MCP1702. It is easy to use, does not need too much C on the output and the package allows for easy cooling.</p>
<p>If you want to keep the MCP1702 you could just use a second one for powering the WIZ820.</p>
<p>But Robert is certainly right with his remarks regarding the limitations of the single supply (and that the full wave rectified version will not work).</p>

     <p>Your problem will be finding a centre-tapped adapter. Your alternative is an on-board transformer that needs to remain well out of saturation at the UK maximum voltage of 253 V, and then you still have the attendant clearance problems etc.</p>

     <p><em>.... with 2 MCP 1702 ... </em></p>
<p>I think this is a good idea (well known parts, keeps the number of different parts low, scalable, etc.). And please give them a bit of copper area (connected to one or several pins) where they can sink the heat. GND plane can also be used for this. Keeping the temperature low improves reliability and reduces output voltage drift.</p>

<p>Sorry,&nbsp; a bad guess and wrong. If you rectify the a.c., you won't be able to tell the difference between imported and exported power because you won't know the relative phase of voltage and current. And if your d.c. supply has a smoothing capacitor inside (most have), you've lost the ability to calculate true power too (for that, you need the average of the product of instantaneous voltage and current).&nbsp; <br />
So you have at best a voltage that has some relationship to the peak voltage, and you can only get an estimate of VA with no knowledge of whether it's import or export.</p>
<p>&quot;To my surprise, the waveform is not very much disturbed.&quot; - Yes, that's because you are taking the same energy over a longer time and drawing a lower current, hence the internal drop in the transformer (from both copper and iron) is less. A higher VA rating helps here with a lower source impedance, but it has no connection with the inherent distortion of the voltage waveform that arises from saturation effects in the tranformer core.</p>

<p>this was also how I understood your question. You just have to make sure that + is on the right contact&nbsp;<img src="../sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/shades_smile.html" alt="" /> and that the power dissipation will be roughly doubled (if you use a wall supply with the same DC voltage as AC RMS). </p>
<p>And then, I am also suprised that the waveforem is not very much disturbed! I understood from Glyns post that 20mA will be the maximum before distortion will make the circuit useless?!? How does this fit together? (and this has absulutely nothing to do with transformer saturation at higher voltages?!?)</p>

<p>I must be missing something! The whole purpose of the single supply was to give the option of a minimal performance  'bare bones' emonTx measuring real power without the need for both a.c. and d.c adapters. If you need more options that draw more power, then a separate d.c. supply was always envisaged. That's what the optional break / link on Glyn's layout is for!</p>
<p>If your extras need more current, or for another reason you do not want the single supply option, then you have no need to worry about R5, you leave it out and feed a clean smoothed d.c. supply across C1, and use the a.c. adapter for the voltage reference only.</p>
<p><a href="../user/1332.html" title="View user profile.">JBecker</a></p>
<p>The specification was indeed for 20 mA - the ATmega328 and RFM12B at 14mA &nbsp;when the RF12B is transmitting, and 2.3 mA each for two DS18B20 temperature sensors. The components were chosen so that at that current and the minimum theoretical supply voltage and worst case component tolerances, the MCP1702 just ran out of headroom and failed to regulate. The distortion on the voltage sample was deemed acceptable, the harmonics introduced are around 1% and the change in rms value is minimal (or to put it another way, I could not discern a difference in the rms voltage readings when the supply was loaded with 20 mA and when it was not - the difference was swamped by normal fluctuations in the mains voltage, so in practice it is likely to be quite immaterial).</p>

<p>thanks for making the reason for 20mA clear. This is more or less as I understood it. More current <em>can</em> be drawn (with different component values) but distortion will certainly increase, possibly up to a level where everybody has to decide for himself if it is still acceptable for his purpose.</p>
<p>And you can clearly see in Amins simulation that the voltage drop in large parts of the positive halfwave is considerable. All this might 'average out' with calibration but will for sure increase the overall measurement error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BR, J&ouml;rg.</p>
<p>PS: I understand Amins question regarding DC supply in that way that he wants to be able to use the exactly same hardware with AC and DC wall adapters (off course without voltage measurement with the DC adapter).</p>

     <p>Something else you might consider:</p>
<p>The original emonTx has no over-voltage protection on the CT&nbsp;inputs. What happens if the CT sees a current of more than 100A? Or in fact, any current great enough for the voltage across the burden resistor to exceed Vcc/2?&nbsp;This will pull the analog input on the CPU outside the 0-Vcc allowed range.</p>
<p>The Atmel datasheet states that the absolute max voltage an any pin is from -0.5 to Vcc + 0.5.</p>
<p>This leads me to believe that it would rather easy to destroy the CPU if there was a current surge caused by a fault somewhere.</p>
<p>This would be&nbsp;especially true if using a larger burden resistor in order to increase the resolution when using the CT on a circuit with a smaller design current. E.g. on a PV inverter, the max expected current might be only 16A not 100A, it would be reasonable to scale up the burden resistor to match.</p>
<p>With the new design, if the op-amp is powered off the 3.3V supply, then I guess this is fine. If powered of 5V, then this could easily drive the analogue-in line above the 3.3+0.5 limit (assuming its output can swing up to the supply), when used on one of the higher gain settings.</p>
<p>Have you considered this? Should you add a couple of diodes to ov and Vcc to limit the swing?</p>

     <p>I think you need to consider the characteristics - particularly the VA rating - of the c.t., and the circuit around it. We know what happens when the c.t. sees a current up to 250 A (been there, done that!) and we know what happens when the burden is changed from the recommended value (been there, done that too!). And it's all documented.</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;The Atmel datasheet states that the absolute max voltage an any pin is from -0.5 to Vcc + 0.5.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That assumes a voltage source of sufficiently low impedance. Yes, it <em>might</em> over-volt the input, but the current available is just within the maximum current for the internal protection diodes. A simple series resistor of a couple of thousand ohms will limit the current to a safe value under all circumstances that I've been able to envisage.</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;only 16A .... it would be reasonable to scale up the burden resistor to match.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, it wouldn't be reasonable, again because the c.t. has a limited VA rating and you will overload the c.t. if you increase the burden resistance too much. (And before you point out the 30 A c.t. with the internal burden, I believe - but don't have evidence - that this is the same part as the 100 A, but with a burden resistor added).</p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;Should you add a couple of diodes to ov and Vcc to limit the swing?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But not any old diodes. They'd need to be Schottky to assure that they would take the lion's share of the current. A series resistor is cheaper and simpler (but maybe not as a retro-fit).</p>

     <p>My point was that we need to be careful not to over-drive the AtMega analogue input. A lmv324 run from 3.3 volts can't do that. The op-amp (and anlogue switch) &nbsp;input itself is probably safe from damage from&nbsp;an over-driven&nbsp;CT due to the series resistors.</p>
<p>The common-mode input voltage operating point is set at Vcc/2 which will be 1.65V. The high open-loop gain of the op-amp and feedback network will ensure that the op-amp input pins won't move much from that.</p>
<p>So in other words, it will work fine.</p>
<p>It's not so clear-cut with the old emonTx design, where the CT burden resistor is connected directly to the CPU with no series resistor or protection diodes or anything. Here, it looks as if we are relying on the CT secondary saturation current being small enough to be safely handled by the CPU's built-in protection diodes. It may be just-about ok with the standard 100A CT, but it's not a great piece of design in my opinion.</p>

<p>Seconded about the old emonTx input. <em>Provided</em> (big IF) the voltage across the burden remains more or less sinusoidal (which it won't), it is only the series impedance of the decoupling capacitor (10&micro;F) at 50 Hz along with the limitations of the c.t&nbsp; that can keep the current within the absolute maximum rating for that input (if all 3 c.t's get saturated at the same time, it's also heading towards the per chip limit as well). I think it's just about OK on a good day, but as you say there's no certainty about it, and I'm just a little bit surprised we haven't seen blown up Atmel chips before now. It only needs a 1 kOhm series resistor to be pretty much guaranteed to be safe even if the burden resistor falls off, provided you have the 22 V zeners still across the c.t. secondary of course. If you're worried about those being absent (30 A c.t with internal burden removed?), the alternative is to clamp the input to the supply rails before the series resistor.</p>
<p>I've been meaning to make a Spice model of the YHDC c.t. so that we can explore that area a bit more thoroughly.</p>

     <p>In the Netherlands almost everyone will soon (within a few years) have a &quot;smart&quot; electricity meter. The smart meter has a serial port on it (port P1) which supplies information about the metered electrical and gas usage.

P1&nbsp;also supplies gas meter information but that is only updated hourly.</p>
