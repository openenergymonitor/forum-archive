        <div class="content"><p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to add web access to my hardware as I&#39;m not especially happy with the reliability of the smart bridge on my enviR units.</p>
<p>I have the emonTX (433Mhz) with the GLCD and my fusion sketch. I also have some external temperature monitoring and may add further nodes.</p>
<p>I have an account with COSM. I would like to retain that and possibly add further feeds to CMS. I presume that I can feed both simultaneously?</p>
<p>What annoys me about the smart bridge is the fact that it seems to freeze more often than it works. It probably isn&#39;t that bad but I find it freezing at least once every week or two. That&#39;s hopeless - I want a reliable feed that I can read remotely at any time.</p>
<p>I want something which runs standalone - no point in always having to run a PC to see the data (not that I think I need to with what is available).</p>
<p>There are several units offered through the forum shop. I plan to buy one of those while supporting the site at the same time. Much as I am willing to play, I don&#39;t want to jump through too many programming hoops so as to get things working reliably. A few hoops is OK, exercise is always good.</p>
<p>Within reason, cost isn&#39;t too big a deal. A few quid more wont kill off one unit over another but spending hundreds isn&#39;t an option though (not that I think I need to).</p>
<p>With these criteria in mind, and based upon your experiences with them, which of the units would you recommend from the shop?</p>
<p>thanks in advance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ian</p>
