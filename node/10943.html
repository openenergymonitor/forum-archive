        <div class="content"><p>Dear All;</p>
<p>I&#39;m brand new on this forum, and I&#39;m, compared to the knowledge level I&#39;m reading, brand new to electronics. So please don&#39;t shoot me down in flames if I make stupid remarks....... Besides that, English is not my native language.</p>
<p>Reading through some of the enormous pile of information available , I haven&#39;t found remarks about the self-consumption of the MK2? Is it just me who is &quot;paranoid&quot; about self consumption of electrical items?&nbsp; About 5 years ago we became very conscious about our energy consumption and had to cut it down. One of our actions was a crusade against 24/7 &quot;vampire&quot;-users. We managed to reduce our yearly electricity grid consumption down to 1000 kWh, before a 1 kWp PV-array was purchased.</p>
<p>Even though I haven&#39;t received the new 2x6V&nbsp;JPR Electrical 835-401 transformer and MK2 PCB&#39;s from Robin yet, the transformer data sheet suggest a 35 mA self-consumption. If the MK2 were to connected 24/7, the transformer would consume 0.035*240*24*365 = 73.6 kWh/year. In our case that would nearly be a 7.4% consumption increase. This increase has to be covered by the grid, or during the day by the PV-array.</p>
<p>For voltage sampling, I do have another 240V transformer, 10.1Vrms 4.8VA on the single secondary, from a Nokia adaptor, which consumes only 6 mA. This one has a little phase shift during my test at 250Vrms, but I guess it looks okay for Voltage sampling? (see attached pictures) For powering the board (connected to the 5V regulator) I could maybe use a SMP-supply, 7.22VDC, which has a 0.35mA self-consumption. This would bring the transformer self-consumption down from 35mA to 6.35mA.......for me a huge saving.</p>
<p>If this idea is no good, and the advise is to stick to Robin&#39;s transformer, has anybody got some idea&#39;s to switch the MK2 off during the night? I tested a timer, but its consumption was also around 30 mA. Maybe via taking a signal from the inverter when it goes into the &quot;sleep&quot;-mode during the night? Powering down the MK2 during the night, regardless its consumption, would be ideal of course. Alternatively, if possible, having just the board powered by the SMP-supply (0.35mA self-consumption + board consumption)</p>
<p>Has anybody had some thoughts / idea&#39;s about this?</p>
<p>Hope to hear.....</p>
<p>Roland.</p>
