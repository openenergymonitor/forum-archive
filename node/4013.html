        <div class="content"><p>I have long been planning to use a combination of Arduinos and a central server to monitor and control my energy domestic energy usage. I have bought a number of Arduinos and have computers that could act as a controlling server, although I am gradually coming over to using something like a Pi.</p>
<p>
	Presently, I have 3 phase electricity coming into my house (via my garage which is about 10 metres away from the nearest part of the house.&nbsp; I have a 10Kw solar PV system.&nbsp; The 3 phase inverter is adjacent to the garage supply.&nbsp; Presently I have an oil boiler heating water for a ten zone (in effect, every room is a separate zone) underfloor heating system, served by three manifolds and a pump on each manifold.&nbsp; Each zone has a wax valve to turn it on or off.&nbsp; I am intending to install a solar thermal heat source at some point, and two heat pumps - one will be standard electricity, and the other is a prototype which is a little more &#39;interesting&#39; in concept and which we are designing and installing as a proof of concept.&nbsp; We&#39;ll be installing a large water buffer tank or tanks (between 500 litres and 1000 litres probably). Grid tie in is standard UK. I also want to put up a small wind turbine to charge a battery bank (probably), which will discharge at night to provide power at night. I&#39;d like to ensure that all that is generated is used in-house and does not leak back to the grid.</p>
<p>This is what I want to do with this system:</p>
<p>Phase one.&nbsp; Monitor power generated by solar pv and divert power to different recipient systems - immersion heater/s, battery chargers, and/or heat pump.&nbsp; I realise that I might have to power the heat pump from electricity stored in a battery/inverter system, as there may be issues otherwise using a triac to power the heat pump sporadically.&nbsp; I have a number of places I can use excess power generated.&nbsp; From reading the forums etc., my understanding is that I&#39;ll probably need a separate Arduino-based monitoring and diversion system on each of the three phases. I&#39;d like each of these to transmit data to a central server, but they might be able to transmit the data directly to a triac located near, for example, an immersion heater.&nbsp; One system for each phase.&nbsp; In other words, energy monitoring and control on each phase, but with the option of switching the energy diversion to a different dump, if required.</p>
<p>Phase two. Monitor temperatures in all rooms and externally and fully control the heating system.&nbsp; Learn the thermo-dynamics of each room and be able to predict temperatures accordingly, so a particular room will be heated when required and not heated at other times.&nbsp; Have manual intervention via an app or browser interface from devices such as a phone and/or tablet linked over a wifi network and over the internet.&nbsp; This might be extended to include security monitoring.&nbsp; Phase two is significant because onward development potential is enormous.&nbsp; Essentially, the system is a large number of temperature sensors probably on a one wire bus attached to a number of Arduinos reporting to a central server, which tracks everything and switches heat sources on/off, pumps on/off, zones on/off etc.etc. And then the rest...</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m reasonably competent but am learning about electricity (phases/sine waves etc. etc.).&nbsp; I used to program but have not done so for 30 years. I am not that knowledgeable about electronics.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m posting to check if I am being realistic in hoping to do this myself, and to seek information sources regarding elements not already covered in the forums here.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>You can achieve this right now with an emonTH and a fistful of D18B20 sensors, calling in to a locally hosted emonCMS installation on a Pi, and using the packet generator to issue control instructions. I have a single emonTH&nbsp;measuring the temperature of five rooms on my first floor, plus humidity in the bathroom, at a total cost of &lt; &pound;40 (plus the emonBase, aka Raspberry Pi!)</p>
<p>Like you, my electronics knowledge is low, I can barely solder two wires together...</p>
<p>The latter part isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve done myself but is an active area of work; I&#39;m sure someone will be able to comment.</p>
<p>There&#39;s an active group around PV diversion - again, someone will no doubt comment shortly.</p>
