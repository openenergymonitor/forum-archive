     <p>Hi Neil,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that you are struggling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could I suggest the main OpenEnergyMonitor&nbsp;getting started guide as a good starting point:<a href="../guide.html">&nbsp;<strong style="font-size: 12px;">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/guide</strong></a>. There si also a good overview of the modules we offer through the shop on our website <a href="http://megni.co.uk/">http://megni.co.uk</a></p>
<p>If you are after module specific documentation see the modules section of if you are after more general electronics / microprocessor / physics background info see the &#39;building blocks&#39; sections.</p>
<p>Maybe if you posted what you intend to setup of what you would like to achieve we could help you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best wishes,&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>I believe, if memory serves me correctly, that there is another forum member in Orkney. Maybe he&#39;ll see this and get in touch. If not, there are quite a few knowledgeable members around and as Glyn says, tell us what you have, and what you want to achieve, and we&#39;ll do our best to steer you in the right direction.</p>
<p>It would be a great help if people did say their geographical location in the &quot;About&quot; section of their profile, we&#39;d then be able to make a decent guess about their electricity supply system - which can be quite useful to know.</p>

    <div class="content">
     <p>Glyn,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply; I fear it is even more basic than the guide (which I had pored over several times before originally posting). It is better than it was when I last had a serious try to crack this a few months ago... and then gave up. However it still starts at about O-level when I am probably kindergarten!</p>
<p>You asked about projects: I was trying to get the heat pump monitor to work, but at the moment I really haven&#39;t a clue where to start. (I&#39;ve ready John Cantor&#39;s piece, but it is above me for the moment) So I&#39;d be happy to get the current clamp to work to begin with.</p>
<p>So from the top:</p>
<p>I have a EmonTx 868MHz, a NanodeRF SMT 868MHz, The USB loader, 100A sensor and 4 x&nbsp;DS18B20 temp sensors (I think I need 5, but will see if I get that far!)</p>
<p>I would like to be sure of 3 areas:</p>
<p>1. Is what I have got actually working (because I soldered the EmonTX up myself and don&#39;t really know if it is cooked anywhere)?</p>
<p>2. Nanode: I have plugged it into my home network hub with a CAT5 cable. When I plug in the loader (to the laptop USB) I get a blue LED on the loader and an alternating red and green flashing on the board adjacent to the loader pins. The network port LED also come on (hub light flashing in sync with the other ports) and one blinking LED and one fixed LED at the&nbsp;CAT5 socket on the board. (is this right so far?) I have nothing in the micro USB socket.</p>
<p>What do I need to do to get the Board active? I am assuming I need to load a sketch, but not really sure of which one, from where and where it should be stored. I understand it needs to be in a library, but I am not ABSOLUTELY&nbsp;sure of the structure needed or the files to be accessed. I am assuming the Nanode only needs software to pass the incoming wireless signal through the&nbsp;CAT5, so it does not care about what sensors are attached to the EMonTX.</p>
<p>So what happens to the data? How will I look at what is coming in? With what will I view the data?</p>
<p>Will the unit power itself from the CAT5 cable when it is running or do I need to provide a power supply? (if so what/how as I don&#39;t see the input opportunity (unless it is the micro USB)</p>
<p>3. The EmonTx. What sketches will I need to load to just use the 100A clamp? (and can it just plug into the jack socket 1 on the board, or do I need something else?) The same issues about what software and where to load apply, although I can see this has a 9V&nbsp;supply. I am expecting to power the EmonTx from this 9V&nbsp;source.</p>
<p>I am anticipating moving the loader over to the EmonTX&nbsp; after the Nanode is up and running (or do I need a loader for each and keep them permanently attached - I am assuming not)</p>
<p>I am sure a lot of these are REALLY noddy questions, so answering them bit by bit would be real progress.</p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>
<p>Neil</p>

    <div class="content">
     <p>OK, first: are you on Windows, Linux or Mac?</p>
<p>2. This indicates that the Nanode is basically working. The sketch (the program that you load into the Nanode to get it to do what you want) that flashes the LEDs alternately is a test sketch, so in due course you&#39;ll need&nbsp; to get rid of that and load a different one.</p>
<p>1. You won&#39;t know whether the emonTx is fully working (i.e. the radio department is correct) until you have a working receiver. That&#39;s what the Nanode is (as well as other things). But you can set it up and test a lot of the functionality without that by using your laptop as a monitor.</p>
<p>So let&#39;s tackle this in small steps. Have you gone through <a href="https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/?redirect=setting-up-the-arduino-environment">Setting up the Arduino IDE</a>? If not, do that first. If you&#39;re on Linux, when you get to &quot;Installing Libraries and Firmware with your browser&quot;, follow the instructions. If you&#39;re on Windows, you need to follow the instructions on <em>how</em> to download but where you put the files is slightly different. On my machine I have a &quot;Documents&quot; directory. Under that, I have &quot;OpenEnergy&quot; in which are directories for the hardware, application notes, data sheets etc plus one called &quot;Software&quot;. This is the &quot;Sketchbook location&quot; set in the Arduino IDE (Preferences). In Software I have directories for the emonTX V2, emonTx V3, Nanode, etc plus one called &quot;libraries&quot;. It is there that I have&nbsp;dallas_temperature_control, EmonLib, jeelib, etc.</p>
<p>For now, don&#39;t do anything about installing Git. STOP immediately before and DON&#39;T do &quot;Installing Libraries and Firmware using git&quot;</p>
<p>In the last step you did before you stopped, you should have downloaded and unzipped a whole directory full of subdirectories with names like &quot;EmonTx_CT123....&quot; These contain the sketches that you&#39;ll start with.</p>
<p>Let us know how you get on this far. To deal with a couple of the other points:</p>
<p><em>&quot;Will the unit power itself from the CAT5 cable when it is running or do I need to provide a power supply? (if so what/how as I don&#39;t see the input opportunity (unless it is the micro USB)</em>&quot;</p>
<p>No, it needs a 5 V d.c. power supply which is what the micro USB is for. The same goes for your emonTx (if it is the older version 2 - look for the version number printed on the pcb in white ink). The old (V2) emonTx does NOT get its power from the 9 V a.c. adapter. That is only for measuring the mains voltage.</p>
<p><em>&quot;I am anticipating moving the loader over to the EmonTX&nbsp; after the Nanode is up and running (or do I need a loader for each and keep them permanently attached - I am assuming not)&quot;</em></p>
<p>Having said the Nanode and probably the emonTx both need a 5 V d.c. supply - no they don&#39;t while they are plugged in to the &quot;loader&quot;/programmer. You don&#39;t need to keep the programmer or the computer connected once the whole system is working, and you can swap from one to the other. A tip: mark the programmer and the sockets with a blob of paint at one end so that you don&#39;t accidentally get it the wrong way round.</p>
<p>3. We&#39;ll get on to this in the next step.</p>

     <p>Glyn,</p>
<p>I do appreciate your time on this so here goes:</p>
<p>I am using Windows.</p>
<p>I believe I have set up the Arduino as required (but only think so). I attach a screen shot of the directory structure. I HAVE got the &#39;Library set up the same way. Glad of any suggestions to change. (I think I may have&nbsp;duplicate directories of some directories such as &#39;CP210x_VCP_Windows&#39; and &#39;emonTxFirmware-master&#39;- in which case I propose deleting those with a bracketed suffix.</p>
<p>I seem to have a &#39;download&#39; directory which contains the Nanode info, but I do not seem to see it elsewhere. This was all downloaded some time ago and I don&#39;t seem to have written notes on what I have done, so if it needs wiping and starting again then there is nothing lost.</p>
<p>I do seem to have the FTDI USB drivers which I understand is for the programmer?</p>
<p>I am not sure about the EmonTx_CT123 set of files,</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying the&nbsp;role of the micro USB and the &#39;non-use&#39; of the jack socket. In terms of power: when I have uploaded sketches to the Nanode and the EmonTX, do they need to be continuously powered? i.e. can I set them up through the PC and then take them to another location and then power them up with the 5V&nbsp;Micro USB? Will they hold the programme in transit, or do I need to be programming them IN their final location and keeping them continuously powered (as we get power cuts here)</p>

    <div class="content">
     <p>Hi Neil, how did you get on with the storm? (BTW, I&#39;m not Glyn!)</p>
<p>You&#39;ve got your Arduino IDE in &quot;My Documents&quot;. Mine is under &quot;Program Files&quot; but that shouldn&#39;t matter, so long as the file association points to the right place (i.e. you click on a .ino file it should start the IDE). You do have a lot of duplicate directories, I guess you downloaded the files several times to do that, so it would be a good idea to find which is in use and delete the unused ones. My CP210... directories have been moved to off-line storage as they&#39;re not needed once you have installed the drivers. These are indeed the FTDI drivers that enable the IDE to talk over the USB interface to the programmer.</p>
<p>The emonTx files you are going to need are inside the directory emonTxFirmware-master (and you can delete the second copy of that too).</p>
<p>So that you don&#39;t get the Emon stuff mixed up with everything else, I suggest you make an OpenEnergyMonitor directory beneath &quot;Arduino&quot;, then move all the OEM subdirectories into there, that is emonTxFirmware-master, NanodeRF-master and any others but not Jeelib nor lame.</p>
<p>Now it is in there - your new OpenEnergyMonitor directory - that you need to make a directory &quot;libraries&quot; (in addition to the one under &quot;Arduino&quot;) and into this new one you need to move jeelib-master, and you must rename it to &quot;jeelib&quot;. Also in the new &quot;libraries&quot; directory you must have the other libraries that OEM sketches need, e.g EmonLib. The reason for two libraries directories is the Arduino one gets updated when you update the IDE, and it&#39;s easier if the OEM one is separate.</p>
<p>The sketch is held in EEPROM in the EmonTx so it&#39;ll stay there indefinitely once loaded, power or no power. So no worries there.</p>
<p>So I suggest you straighten out your directory structure, then have a look in the emonTxFirmware-master directory and there you should find a directory emonTx_CT123_Voltage and inside there two files. Double-click on emonTx_CT123_Voltage.ino and it should open in the Arduino IDE on the first tab, and the second file emontx_lib.ino should automatically appear on the second tab. (If it doesn&#39;t happen, you need to run the Arduino IDE directly and in &quot;File&quot; &gt; &quot;Preferences&quot; make sure &quot;Automatically associate .ino files with Arduino&quot; is ticked.) Also in the IDE in &quot;File&quot; &gt; &quot;Preferences&quot; set the &quot;Sketchbook location&quot; to your new OpenEnergyMonitor directory. Click &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Serial Port&quot; and you&#39;ll probably have &quot;COM3&quot;. Plug in your USB lead with the programmer and emonTx, click &quot;Tools&quot; &gt; &quot;Serial Port&quot; again and check that &quot;COM4&quot; (or a new port) has appeared. Select the new port. Now try uploading the sketch. That&#39;s &quot;File&quot; &gt; &quot;Upload&quot; or the right arrow icon, or Ctrl-U. If it says &quot;Compiling sketch...&quot; and does it, then &quot;Binary sketch size: 9,808 bytes (of a 32,256 byte maximum)&quot; then &quot;Uploading&quot;, then &quot;Done uploading&quot;, you&#39;re in the money. But don&#39;t celebrate, the sketch won&#39;t work totally because the radio frequency is wrong. If however after compiling you get the dreaded &quot;avrdude: stk500_getsync(): not in sync: resp=0x00&quot;, then there&#39;s a problem communicating with the emonTx.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s see how you get on with that.</p>

     <p>What is that trying to tell you? In fact, can you find the file jeelib.h? More importantly, can <strong>it</strong> find the file jeelib.h? Without seeing the whole error message (and that would allow me to explain it to you), I suspect that&#39;s what has happened. Have you now got the directory structure I outlined, did you rename jeelib?</p>
<p>[Edit] Having just done a little experiment - no you haven&#39;t (apparently) got the directory structure correct, or you missed setting the sketchbook location in the IDE Preferences. The &quot;libraries&quot; directory needs to be a subdirectory of that Sketchbook location, as does any directory (or subdirectory thereof) containing your sketches.</p>

     <p>Robert,</p>
<p>There IS a file called Jeelib.h in the &#39;OpenEnergyMonitor/Libraries/Jeelib directory. See attached screen shot of the error message and then the directory structure.</p>
<p>I <u>think </u>I have the directory structure as specified.....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried copying and pasting the error message into the mail, but it came back warning of a spam filter. I am assuming this is to protect the forum?</p>

<p>Sorry, when I was looking at your posting I didn&#39;t see the 2nd para.</p>
<p>Bear with me while I digest it and I&#39;ll come back to you tomorrow. <em>Wife is making clucking noises about me being on the PC on Boxing day night!</em></p>

     <p>That&#39;s only the tail end of the error message - you always need to start reading error messages from the top (and yes, I blame the IDE for leaving it like that and not scrolling back to the top).</p>
<p>I tried changing the path in the IDE Preferences, and then I get a similar message, so I still think it can&#39;t find that file.</p>
<p>This is (part of) my structure.The highlighted &quot;Software&quot; directory is the &quot;Sketchbook location&quot;.</p>

<p>I have made a right hash of this, so I am minded to delete the whole lot and start again. Any tips before I do so?</p>

     <p>I think that&#39;s going to be the safest way to clean up. Don&#39;t worry.</p>
<p>I like to keep programs entirely separate from my data. The latter gets backed up, programs don&#39;t, but I do keep the installation files / distribution zip files offline, so I can reinstall from that without the need to download. I also like to keep things reasonably organised and compartmentalised (but I frequently fail!). So what follows is based on that.</p>
<p>Tips:</p>
<p>1. Read through the &quot;Setting up the Arduino Environment&quot; and all the installation instructions and figure out exactly what you are downloading when. Make notes on paper and don&#39;t download anything until you&#39;re reasonably happy and you&#39;ve decided where you want to put things. Re-read my post of Sun, 22/12/2013 - 17:42. and my subsequent ones. Decide on a structure for how you want to organise yourself:</p>
<p>2. I suggest you should put the Arduino IDE where the rest of your programs are in &quot;Program Files&quot; [but you don&#39;t have to.]</p>
<p>3. I suggest you should have a separate directory for all your OEM stuff as a child of &quot;My Documents&quot;. In my case in &quot;OpenEnergyMonitor&quot; I&#39;ve got hardware (PCB layouts and diagrams), BB articles, test reports, design calcs, data sheets, app notes etc; and a &quot;Software&quot; directory - as per the screenshot above, though you can only see a tiny fraction of the parent &quot;OpenEnergyMonitor&quot; - &quot;Single Supply&quot; and &quot;SMT EmonTx&quot; are the only two subdirectories of it that you can see.</p>
<p>If you like that (it works for me, it might not for you!):</p>
<p>4. Delete (or rename) all the Arduino-related stuff. Remove the drivers (it probably isn&#39;t necessary, but you&#39;ll feel happier starting with a clean slate).</p>
<p>5. Install the Arduino IDE.</p>
<p>6. Install the drivers.</p>
<p>7. Make your &quot;OEM&quot; directory and a &quot;Software&quot; subdirectory of it and subdirectories of that for the libraries, emonTx, Nanode. i.e.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Documents<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OpenEnergyMonitor<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Software<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; libraries<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; emonTx<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NanodeRF</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [*Data sheets]<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [*Build instructions]</p>
<p>[*these are at your discretion]</p>
<p>8. Download all the libraries listed in <a href="https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/?redirect=installing-arduino-libraries">Installing Arduino Libraries</a> and put them in this &quot;libraries&quot;. Remember to rename &quot;Jeelib-master&quot; to &quot;jeelib&quot;. That should give you something like what I&#39;ve got under &quot;libraries&quot;.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download emonTxfirmware master (.zip) and extract the contents into &quot;emonTx&quot;.<br />
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do the same for NanodeRF into &quot;NanodeRF&quot;.</p>
<p>9. Run the Arduino IDE and set &quot;Sketchbook location&quot; to &quot;....\My Documents\OpenEnergyMonitor\Software&quot;</p>
<p>10. Cross fingers, load an emonTx sketch, connect up and give it a go.</p>
