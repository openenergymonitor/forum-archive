        <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="../user/3862.html" title="View user profile.">GJPickard</a> on Mon, 21/04/2014 - 14:05</span>
        <div class="content"><p>It looks like my first SD card is getting a bit flaky (about 5 months wear).</p>
<p>The problem I had was moving the image onto a new SD card. &nbsp;I made the mistake of popping in a 16GB SD card and then expanding&nbsp;the file system to fill it. &nbsp;To compound the issue I have run into the same problem as lots others - 16GB (etc) is not the same on all cards.</p>
<p>The goal was to drop the image size to, say, 7.5Gb so I can use any 8GB or greater card and then just use Win32 Disk Imager to back up/restore images.</p>
<p>A lot of&nbsp;Googling later I found myself at a dead end. &nbsp;I could reduce the partition size (GParted&nbsp;worked as did a couple of Windows based backup/partition managers) - the issue was&nbsp;Win32 Disk Imager would always create a 16GB (etc) image as it dumps the full card regardless of whether there was any data in a partition. &nbsp;So your X GB card always produces an X GB&nbsp;image - and as SD cards seem to be a few bytes different &nbsp;even if the same brand/type then&nbsp;Win32 Disk Imager will give you a &quot;cannot fit&quot; type of error.</p>
<p>It looked like my only option was going to be running DD in a Linux&nbsp;environment - maybe Ubuntu live on a USB keydrive. &nbsp;Before I went this route I thought I would have a quick look at some back up software options I had installed to see if any of them was happy with reading Linux partitions.</p>
<p>I struck lucky first time with&nbsp;AOMEI Backupper (a cuddlier front end to the&nbsp;AOMEI freeware disk cloning/ partitioning software). By now I had already shrunk the partition to around 7GB using GParted on a boot CD , however, I have used AOMEI before to do this. &nbsp;I did a backup of the 16GB card and simply restored the image to an 8GB SD card. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For the restore I only restored the Boot (FAT32) and Data (Linux) partitions leaving out the unallocated space created when I reduced the Data partition beforehand. A quick finger-cross later and it seems to be working.</p>
<p>I will report back if any issues show up.</p>
