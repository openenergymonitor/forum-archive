     <p>The most common&nbsp;dilemma raised&nbsp;in the forum is whether the member is &#39;highlighting a bug in the system which needs sorting&#39; or &#39;I&#39;m a newbie and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;ve done something wrong&#39;.<br />
Often it&#39;s difficult to separate the two, as highlighted above, and confirmation that a module is not compatible&nbsp;is much easier to accept than thinking that you&#39;ve done something stupid!</p>
<p>Paul, I think that you will have a lot of support with this - despite the lack of supporting posts!! and if you are prepared to invest&nbsp;your time into &nbsp;resolving this, how specifically can forum members / T&amp;G support you.</p>

     <p>I&#39;m pretty sure this is not something I can fix, If it is supposed to work then I am happy to persevere or if it&#39;s broke I&#39;m happy to contribute to locating the cause or maybe fixing it, but if it is no longer compatible either because of the big changes in v8.5/v8.6/v9 or has never accommodated&nbsp;the php feed engines and or low-write/feedwriter then it is probally&nbsp;beyond my php and emoncms&nbsp;know how.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time I had it working was with the debian&nbsp;package manager&nbsp;(apt-get) installed versions of&nbsp;emoncms&nbsp;(~v8.3.2?)&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;emoncms-event-module&nbsp;package. Currently I would like it but I get by fine without it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally I think all support issues should be based here on the forum and only if and when it is established something needs addressing in the source code should an issue be opened with links to the forum discussion. That keeps the debugging, discussion, advice and guides all on the forum and a concise up&nbsp;to date dialogue&nbsp;of known issues and their status&nbsp;on the repo as a kind of evolving changelog.&nbsp;But there are no clear guidelines on this and no policing/management&nbsp;of issues here or on the repos.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not overly bothered about the events module for my own use right now. but I am frustrated&nbsp;by leaving users hanging when they ask for help and I don&#39;t know the answers or even where to look/how to find out and a little&nbsp;concerned that it may&nbsp;fade away from emoncms and not be there if I do need&nbsp;it some day.</p>
<p>If anyone has a fully working events module can you post your emoncms version number and likewise if you know it doesn&#39;t work with a particular version because it was working prior to an upgrade or you are familiar with the events module and knowingly chose a version accepting it wouldn&#39;t work please share that info. If I/we can establish if it&nbsp;should work in it&#39;s current form (as opposed to if&nbsp;we want it to work).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please do not post about&nbsp;bugs or unsuccessful install attempts in hope of help in this thread, I&#39;m hoping to gather the info required to fix the module and or help other issues in <u>other</u> threads.</p>
<p>If your name happens to be Trystan&nbsp;or Chaverio, perhaps you can shed some light or advise what to look for?? as far as I can fathom, it worked up&nbsp;to v8.4 &quot;full&quot; but but not (fully?)&nbsp;since and&nbsp;cannot confirm if it&#39;s low-write compatible.</p>
<p>I would ideally like&nbsp;to get back to emonHub&nbsp;development but that is working&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">at least</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">or help out with the </span>emoncms<span style="line-height: 1.6;"> stuff in progress</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;right now so hopefully this can be fixed&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">without</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;"> getting in&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">too deep.</span></p>

<p>Probably an expected post, but the event module doesn&#39;t work with this version, installed it tonight, the &#39;test&#39; function sent a tweet ok, so the Twitter Auth process&nbsp;at least works,&nbsp;but noticed that all of my feeds stopped updating for some reason.&nbsp;<br />

     <p>Thanks Paul, I had tried v9 with no joy, your findings at least confirm I&#39;m not doing something daft during install and that the twitter bit still works (on test) and that IS possibly feed related, sorry you broke yours while testing.</p>
<p>Nick (elyobelyob - the original auther&nbsp;?) has hinted at some recent changes to the global variable $feed could be the cause so I suspect the v8.5&gt; compatibility&nbsp;is severed. and his questioning the (SQL) fed naming&nbsp;might suggest a lack of compatibility with php&nbsp;feeds which are the only ones available in (&lt;v8.5) low-write emoncms.</p>
<p>​But this is just uninformed speculation at this point, we need the opinion of a capable&nbsp;developer or enough case examples to prove a pattern hence my appeal for info. I expect the response to be slow (if any) as no users with a working event module will find this in a search and less active users with a working set up may not visit often.</p>
<p>But at least now as users pop up with issues I/we can point to this thread and say we are aware rather than just leaving them hanging.</p>

     <p>Yes, I was the original author. Unfortunately, if the project is going to branch off in all different directions and the developer/s for these changes don&#39;t keep in mind other modules and their dependencies, then those modules will die a death. TBH, I really wanted the event module to become a core module and therefore be included in all&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we&#39;re not getting much response from Trystan&nbsp;in these threads and I&#39;m not going to be able to spend the time rewriting the entire module. So, unfortunately, from my perspective, this module is no longer supported.</p>
<p>It was certainly useful from my perspective after I spent my Christmas holidays writing it a few years back. It doesn&#39;t work for me now and I have had to disable my events to keep the project running. All in all a bit of a shame, but seeing the amount of branches v number of developers, it was of no surprise to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, if we had based the project around an MQTT&nbsp;feed, it would have made life a lot easier and the event module wouldn&#39;t have been as hacky as it is. Using a HTTP API is an awful overhead.</p>
<p>Sorry all.</p>

     <p>@ Nick - I share your frustration, but the splitting out into multiple versions started way back with the low-write version which as far as I know (and&nbsp;keep mentioning without attracting any confirmation) wasn&#39;t ever compatible, the events module was still used with the main version until a few months back, as you know the MQTTwarn&nbsp;stuff was added by sumnerboy and nubble. The recent explosion of branches will hopefully be reined in soon as there is alot of effort being put into v9 which will <span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">hopefully</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">replace most of the current branches.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">If there has been a recent change (which I suspect there has) that has severed the link I&#39;m fairly sure it wasn&#39;t known about and I&#39;m hopeful that it will be restored, no-one is suggesting it needs rewriting, we have only just confirmed there is&nbsp;an issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.6;">MQTT is playing a&nbsp;part in&nbsp;emoncms&#39;s&nbsp;future of&nbsp;that we are pretty certain, but the http api will alway be part of it&#39;s history and must continue to be included not only for backward compatibility, but also as not all users can or will make the jump to MQTT&nbsp;and forcing a choice will only divide emoncms again.</span></p>

     <p>The entire event module could be distilled down to a single *MQTT target* IMO - once you have MQTT&nbsp;pubs being generated&nbsp;you can decouple all your email/twitter/pushover&nbsp;targets from EmonCMS entirely (and implement&nbsp;via something like NodeRed or mqttwarn). Much cleaner solution, and no need for all this&nbsp;target-specific coding in EmonCMS (i.e. twitter libraries etc).</p>
<p>Agree however that this puts a burden on the user to run their own MQTT broker. I get the impression however that anyone running EmonCMS locally will have the *know-how* to do this?</p>

     <p>Ben, yes agreed, this is the route that I would prefer.<br />
Currently, I&#39;m using node-red with the http api to obtain data, but would much prefer MQTT..<br />

     <p>So are we saying the events module should just&nbsp;be totally independent of emoncms&nbsp;? or done away with entirely even?</p>
<p><em>Currently, I&#39;m using node-red with the http api to obtain data, but would much prefer MQTT..</em></p>
<p>Why are you not using the publish to MQTT process?</p>
<p>We shouldn&#39;t allow MQTT implementation and the events module to become confused, I thought the comments where about using MQTT to (internally?) &nbsp;link emoncms to the events module (not sure I agree though) and not about using the events module to get MQTT or using MQTT to make the events module redundant in favor of node-red etc.</p>
<p>Putting aside MQTT for a moment, Since&nbsp;emoncms should have it regardless of the event module and thats a differnt discussion.</p>
<p>As far as I recall the events module worked well prior to the low-write version and then v8.5. The &quot;drop it in the Modules folder and update&amp;check&quot; was simple and the &quot;apt-get install emoncms-module-event&quot; was even better. I really do not think forcing users to set up a MQTT&nbsp;broker etc etc just to get an email if things go wrong is a good path, a few users struggle to just get emoncms&nbsp;installed (that&#39;s not their fault, it&#39;s not made easy for them)</p>
<p>With the current &quot;extra processes&quot; available in XT or v9 should &quot;events&quot; be triggered from the processing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are alot&nbsp;of enthusiasts on here and MQTT should definitely be provided to integrate everything you want but some users just want a full featured energy monitor without becoming fully fledged&nbsp;home automation geeks like us :-)&nbsp;</p>

     <p><em>So are we saying the events module should just&nbsp;be totally independent of emoncms&nbsp;? or done away with entirely even?</em><br />
Yes, totally independent. Emoncms&nbsp;can&#39;t be &#39;all things to all men&#39;, where do we draw the line?&nbsp;there has to be a cut off point in all software, what are emoncms&#39;s core functions, and what are conduits to other functionality?</p>
<p><em>Why are you not using the publish to MQTT process?</em><br />
Is this working?&nbsp;last I heard was that it wasn&#39;t complete and needed further work.&nbsp;Where is this documented in Building Blocks, OEM Blog or git?</p>
<p><em>We shouldn&#39;t allow MQTT implementation and the events module to become confused, I thought the comments where about using MQTT to (internally?) &nbsp;link emoncms to the events module (not sure I agree though) and not about using the events module to get MQTT or using MQTT to make the events module redundant in favor of node-red etc.</em><br />
No confusion, Ben was talking about the [internal] use of MQTT linking to the events module, whilst I was talking about the ethos of using MQTT&nbsp;as&nbsp;a common communication medium, which could be used if users had a use... both&nbsp;internally and user facing.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>IMO letting me know my energy monitor is not monitoring energy&nbsp;or&nbsp;that I am consuming too much&nbsp;are&nbsp;more in line with the role of an energy monitor than say controlling my central heating, (for example), Agreed there should be a line but if and when it is defined it&nbsp;does not need to be rigid&nbsp;and&nbsp;non-negotiable.</p>
<p>I want to be clear (again) that I&#39;m not against MQTT, far from it I would like to encourage it&#39;s use. I just don&#39;t see the desire for MQTT as a valid&nbsp;argument <em>against</em>&nbsp;the&nbsp;current events module, can&#39;t we have both even?, so&nbsp;that isn&#39;t really the discussion here. Is the events module (or at least it&#39;s features) desirable and worth keeping? would it take much to fix, update or&nbsp;integrate it? The decisions about the event module features should be based on these points and IF there was a working alternative that could be considered too.</p>
<p>How would you propose to&nbsp;create &quot;events&quot; on MQTT? are you going to publish every feed you want to potentially trigger an event&nbsp;so that another SW can do the &quot;event&quot; or are you thinking emoncms should do the trigger and that trigger is published? Surely the latter IS the events module&#39;s current role and the event is triggering MQTT?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As <em>far as I&#39;m aware </em>the MQTT&nbsp;process works fine,&nbsp;<a href="10746.html">Publish to MQTT - how do you set it up? [Solved]</a>, the phpMQTT&nbsp;module needs updating (but should really be a dependency rather than in the repo) currently the broker details are hardcoded but could be moved to the settings as&nbsp;the mySQL and redis server details are already defined there. I don&#39;t think it is documented but that&#39;s&nbsp;not uncommon is it?</p>

     <p>I agree with JD, I believe the events module should be core. It&#39;s one thing receiving and displaying readings - having an action on these results is a logical step. Which is why I built it in the first place.</p>
<p>It&#39;s apparent that the modules are secondary to the core OEM code. The core code is taking new direction, without any consideration for dependencies. It seems there are a lot of threads r.e. the broken event module and some people will have a reliance on its functionalities.</p>
<p>So, without some feedback from OEM themselves, there seems little point investing any more time in a short term fix. A definitive direction is required.</p>

     <p>Paul: &nbsp;My post hit moderation and will appear eventually!&nbsp;</p>
<p>To add to the conversation: &nbsp;emonCMS can be used for so much more than home energy monitoring. &nbsp;For example, I&#39;m monitoring a water well pump with an EmonTX. &nbsp;This well&nbsp;has a problem with contaminants jamming&nbsp;a check valve, and if jammed&nbsp;the pump will run more than normal. &nbsp;A notification is sent to the well maintenance guy via&nbsp;e-mail when the pump runs too much, triggering the repair and saving energy (and wear and tear on an expensive 3-phase well pump).</p>

     <p><em>&quot;I believe the events module should be core&quot;&nbsp;</em>quite possibly, I previously questioned the possible use of the new conditional&nbsp;processes, As for being a &quot;core module&quot; I&#39;m not sure a mandatory install is going to fly with emoncms.org, so it would need to at least be user enabled/disabled to appeal too T&amp;G.</p>
<p>v8.52xt/v8.6/v9 is currently&nbsp;only a experimental&nbsp;branch&nbsp;Trystan&nbsp;has shown interest but there has been no indication if&nbsp;Chaveiro&#39;s version will be fully adopted yet, certainly the more it offers, the more compatible it is and the fewer barriers it create the more likely it&#39;s success will be, which adds fuel to&nbsp;this discussion. I would like to see emoncms&nbsp;move forward as a single version that can be configured rather than multiple versions and right now we need to keep a pre-v8.5 &#39;full&#39; version just for users that want the events module like JD.</p>
<p><em>&quot;The core code is taking new direction, without any consideration for dependencies.&quot;&nbsp;</em>I&#39;m still hopeful that&#39;s not the case, I think Chaveiro&nbsp;needs to be involved in the discussion, he may not be aware of the repercussions of the changes made and may have a solution.

     <p>I pretty much fixed as per a different thread, it was due to the changes in the database structure - which the events module enquires against directly. However, it went a bit mad and started sending me repeated messages. I stopped looking at it then.

I&#39;m not opposed to having an events module (I&#39;ve shown my support in previous posts above), but it&nbsp;is clearly not being supported by OEM otherwise they would have kept it up to date &amp; working.

<p><em>How would you propose to&nbsp;create &quot;events&quot; on&nbsp;MQTT?</em><br />
Publish the feed which I want to monitor, and then I would have a much wider range of options to process the feed, and wider source of outputs. For example, if the feed is greater than x, less than x, stays higher than x for x minutes, is higher or lower than a&nbsp;different feed, is greater than x between 7pm and 7am, feed stops updating,&nbsp;etc, etc. Also set up alerts to a much greater variety of&nbsp;options&nbsp;-&nbsp;pushbullet, pushover, boxcar, etc.</p>
<p><em>As&nbsp;far as I&#39;m aware&nbsp;the&nbsp;MQTT&nbsp;process works fine,</em><br />
Yes I did see &amp; contributed to that thread, but there seems to be an issue with&nbsp;resilience - keeping it&nbsp;running&nbsp;especially restarting&nbsp;after&nbsp;a reboot, but I&#39;ll give it a try.</p>

     <p>Hi</p>
<p>Just to report that emoncms&nbsp;and mqtt has been more or less rock solid since I&nbsp;started the post about setting&nbsp;up&nbsp;mqtt. The only issue I had was with the Pi dropping wifi. In the end I used a cable to the router and I have had no problems since. I now have node red generating events from emoncms and even shutting my servers down if voltage is getting low.(I run on a solar battery system and a low voltage dropout is triggered to protect the battery. Node red shuts down the servers when I approach drop out voltage)</p>
<p>Regards</p>

     <p>From the &quot;some users&quot; group:</p>
<p>I&#39;m running emoncms 8.4.0. I recently installed the events module. I have a feed that is either 0 or 1. In the case this feed is 0 I want to set another feed to 0 (i.e. reset a kwd feed to 0).</p>
<p>So I have an event like so:</p>
<p>if feed1 == 0 set feed2 to 0</p>
<p>It works perfectly if I use the test button on the events page but it doesn&#39;t work by itself.</p>
<p>For myself having the events module working would be extremely useful.</p>

     <p>@JD - Thanks for info and links, I had over looked the end-user case for simplicity&nbsp;and integration of events module, that would&nbsp;apply&nbsp;to both independent&nbsp;single site&nbsp;emoncms installs and to a central server setup for multiple locations like emoncms.org, I suspect you are using the latter? Can you tellus what feed types you are using with the events module? I believe there was a compatabilty&nbsp;issue with the &quot;low-write&quot; version way before the &quot;full&quot; versions and would like to establish if that is because of the php feed types or just a &quot;low-write&quot; version thing.</p>
<p>I&#39;m really hopeful about future emoncms &quot;variants&quot; being different &quot;modes&quot; of the same version so all features and fixes are readily available to all users and compatibility is maintained across the board, you should not have to choose between the events module and improved dashboards.</p>
<p>@Ian - Thanks for letting us know.</p>
<p>@Bill - I think many, possibly even most?&nbsp;users actually fall into that category, even though I love playing with this stuff, I want a &#39;live&#39; system that just works with a few moving parts as possible, simple, flexible and reliable to use. Plus I&#39;m not the only one in the house and if I don&#39;t make it easy I&#39;m just giving other a reason to not use it.</p>
<p>@Iain - I would of liked to of helped you further on your&nbsp;<a href="10978.html">Events module test works but not automatically</a>&nbsp;but I can only guess as there is very little info available and I do not have a working instance of the events module. Can you confirm what type of feeds are you using?&nbsp;have&nbsp;you have had any working events (triggered by feeds not on test)? Have you tried any other event/feed combinations?&nbsp;the info would be very useful and if I can help you further I will do so on your thread.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>@JD - sorry not very well worded :-) I guessed your own server, by the url and use of events module, I meant as opposed to a server at each site, Fantastic news about the phpfiwa&nbsp;and&nbsp;phptimeseries feeds, interesting about the set feed as I have been using that whilst doing some tests on v9, guess I shall have to start again if that doesn&#39;t work on a &quot;working system&quot; doh!!</p>

     <p>On the <a href="5230.html#comment-23009">&quot;Event module: I do not receive any email alert&quot;</a>&nbsp;it is pointed out byJD&nbsp;that the 2 &quot;event module&quot; code blocks are not included in the low-write version and that adding them manually does make the event module work with the low-write version. Those 2 same blocks are present in each through to v9 except the low-write versions which are still missing in the latest (v8.5 low-write). I would be good to try adding those to a current low-write install to see if it works, I suspect not as the v8.5 &#39;full&#39; doesn&#39;t work, I cannot find a &quot;v8.4 low-write&quot; in in github so if anyone has the older&nbsp;&quot;pre-emonPi&quot; SDcard image version running and fancies adding those blocks and adding events module&nbsp;I would be keen to hear the outcome.</p>
<p>So to recap, no v8.5&gt; versions work, Since JD is successfully using v8.4 can we assume it&nbsp;broke during the reign of v8.4 (<a href="https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/compare/994e4fee6a19a56df8fe35fbc0a757071ee644ac...master">124 changed files&nbsp;with&nbsp;8,193 additions&nbsp;and&nbsp;1,681 deletions between 1/9/14 and 29/4/15</a>) this could be why Iain&#39;s install doesn&#39;t work despite being v8.4 perhaps JD&#39;s is an earlier v8.4&nbsp;?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried to &quot;git&nbsp;checkout&nbsp;994e4fee6a19a56df8fe35fbc0a757071ee644ac&quot; (restore to the first v8.4 commit)&nbsp;from v9 but there are all sorts of issues (even after rewriting&nbsp;the settings.php)&nbsp;probably v9 is too different???</p>
<p><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">@ Iain - If you want to try the version above, you may have m</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">ore</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;joy than I did, you will&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">probably</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;need to at least&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">redo settings.php, restart&nbsp;</span>apache2<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">check&amp;</span><span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">update. but a negative result may not confirm anything as I didn&#39;t succeed with v9.</span></p>

     <p>@All: &nbsp;I went through my documentation, and it looks like I installed Emoncms&nbsp;8.3.5 in November 2014, and then added one fix late December&nbsp;(to fix the year end Zoom visualization bug, fix authored by chaveiro on Dec 18, 2014) which brought me to 8.4.0 &nbsp;I did not update after that. &nbsp;So the version I&#39;m running is 99% 8.3.5.</p>
<p>I have had a sudden burst of fear as I looked at Github and realized that there is no way to install 8.3.5 anymore - 8.4.0 with non-working Event module (per hendersoniain) is the oldest version available via git.</p>
<p>Am I building a business around a dead module/version?&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Thanks&nbsp;for letting us know, we are getting a timeline now.</p>
<p>v8.3.5 in Nov &#39;14 ? didyou mean v8.3.6 ?</p>
<p>With github you can restore to any point by finding the point in time (commit) and getting the long id number as shown above for the v3.6 to v8.4 change point.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/releases">some &quot;tagged&quot; versions</a> of which both v8.3.6 and v8.4 are present (not all versions are) you will need to look at the commits for each tagged version to be sure of what you are getting, ideally a version should be a definitive&nbsp;snapshot at a specific point in time,&nbsp;but that&#39;s not the case here, you can use tagged version numbers with git checkout too.</p>
<p>If you have a working system the way you like it you could just copy the emoncms folder, delete the settings.php and ZIP it, use that rather than downloading or cloning from git for new installs until the events module &nbsp;and versions are sorted. (In fact if you could share it that might help Iain out and I can install it to do some tests too)</p>

     <p>@ Iain - No problem, We can confirm later. all variants will have the version number but &quot;low-write&quot; or &quot;extended&quot; will be shown too in those cases. Both Chaveiro and Trystan are currently away too so there is unlikely to be much progress right now.</p>

     <p>I&#39;ve just read this topic. Can only support v9 if module craches, fixes should be compatible with lower versions. Don&#39;t have time to code events module tough.</p>
<p>What is the problem with the module on v9 anyway ?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve installed it and top of v9 and after db update it does not crash, didn&#39;t test functionality but that is entirely dependent on module code not emoncms code.</p>
<p>Fast reading the code, the events module is pretty much isolated from the rest of emoncms, apart from:</p>
<p>- increases by and decreases by type only works on mysql feeds and crashes on other feed engines.</p>
<p>- set feed action requires redis.</p>
<p>A personal opinion, this module tries to bring IoT to emoncms as a module. This is a dificult task and maintaining it as a module will be limited to few supported targets.<br />
There are some open source projects just for that: receive an input, optional act on its value, and do some action.</p>
<p>Acting on feed values is already possible with input processor conditional engines (available since 8.5.0 XT) as its also possible to trigger mqtt messages on feed conditions.</p>
<p>Paul Reed already gave a clue on what he&#39;s using: Node-RED. I think its a good open project that can receive input from mqtt and should be explored. A quick google find gave <a href="https://dweet.io/" title="https://dweet.io/">https://dweet.io/</a> but this is hosted by some one and no source code is available.</p>
<p>So configuring inputs with conditional processors + send to mqtt + node-Red is a good alternative.</p>
<p>For future i see using conditional processors + modular processes that one can easy build to give easy support to solutions like dweet.</p>

     <p>I have watched hours of youtube video on MQTT and Node Red. &nbsp;Looks super cool for developers, and much more powerful than the Event module, but not anything that an end-user could use. &nbsp;I still don&#39;t fully understand it myself.</p>
<p>With the Event module, my 75 year old dad can log in and add an event to e-mail when his generator has started... not sure how to duplicate this simplicity any other way.</p>
<p>You guys are far more advanced than I am however, I&quot;m open to suggestions. &nbsp;</p>

     <p>Node-red is pretty much a blank canvas which you can drag and drop &#39;functions&#39; (the correct name is &#39;nodes&#39;) into, and join them together to create things.<br />
So by example, I&#39;ve dropped a MQTT&nbsp;node below (to listen for feed data from emoncms), dropped a &#39;Set Criteria&#39; node next to it (which filters out readings below 5kW), dropped a &#39;Limiter&#39; node (to stop multiple alerts being sent), dropped a &#39;Template&#39; node (which turns the feed reading into a friendly&nbsp;sentence - such as &quot;Hey, you&#39;re&nbsp;using too much power - currently 6202W&quot;)&nbsp;and finally a &#39;Pushover&#39; node (which &#39;pushes&#39; that&nbsp;sentence to my phone).</p>
<p>But the last node could be any one of a range of outputs - it could be a tweet, an&nbsp;email, pushbullet, pushover ect. there&#39;s new nodes being added all of the time.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="../sites/default/files/nodered.jpg" style="width: 720px; height: 92px;" /></p>
<p>The whole purpose of node-red is to allow people who <u>cannot write code</u> to use their imaginations and develop whatever they want by dragging &amp; dropping nodes. I fall into that category, and yet I&#39;ve found node-red fairly easy to use.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that when someone creates something really useful, they <a href="http://flows.nodered.org/">generally share what they&#39;ve done</a>, and you can simply import their work into your node-red and start using it.</p>

     <p>We already have provision for emailing within emoncms and the ability to &quot;publish&nbsp;to&nbsp;mqtt&quot; so it would not take much to add<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">&nbsp;email or&nbsp;</span>mqtt<span style="line-height: 20.7999992370605px;">,</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&quot;event</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;notification</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&quot; process(es) with args for</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">&nbsp;topic/email address, message(inc val), </span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">repeti</span><span style="line-height: 1.6;">tion interval(snooze before </span>re-notification<span style="line-height: 1.6;">).

<p>@ Iain - that is a low-write version, only the full versions had the &quot;event module code&quot; needed for the event module to&nbsp;work, the code can be added but I don&#39;t think that is the whole solution, you will need to back date to pre v8.4 as well.</p>

     <p>Unfortunately&nbsp;not Iain, you have 2 bridges to cross. The first is that&nbsp;low-write variants (required for Pi SDcard) do not have the 2&nbsp;events module code blocks. See JD&#39;s fix in&nbsp;<a href="5230.html#comment-23009">Event module: I do not receive any email alert</a>. You can&nbsp;add the blocks to a low-write emoncms, or switch to a &quot;full&quot; emoncms not on a SDcard (or SSD, USB stick etc). The second is that you need a compatible&nbsp;version of emoncms&nbsp;either by backdating to a version around v8.3.6 or early v8.4.0, (that may not have other features or fixes) or by fixing&nbsp;the current version(s) and make them&nbsp;compatible. But we have not yet established the cause of the break.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since those that could won&#39;t, and those that would can&#39;t, it looks unlikely the events module will make a come back. That is fine in this instance, if a replacement is implemented in the core as suggested above. But pretty poor if the only option is to over complicate things with a mandatory installation of, and crash course in, mqtt, node red and/or something else just to get an email out of emoncms, based on a feed value when it can already email you a password reset.</p>
<p>Either way, it doesn&#39;t promote the development or use of optional modules when they are effectively unsupported, which affects the overall&nbsp;appeal of emoncms itself. Very poor show !!! (IMO)</p>

     <p>Yes my coding skills (or more correctly lack of) are not up to updating the events module. However, reading through PB66&#39;s post with reference to:</p>
<blockquote><p>is that&nbsp;low-write variants (required for Pi SDcard) do not have the 2&nbsp;events module code blocks see <a href="5230.html#comment-23009">JD&#39;s fix in&nbsp;Event module: I do not receive any email alert</a>. You can&nbsp;add the blocks to a low-write emoncms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the two blocks as suggested and my events module seems to be working as required now - that is my requirements of setting a feed value back to zero depending on another feed value is working for me now. I am happy with that for now so thank you PB66 for pointing me in the correct direction.</p>

     <p>I&#39;m glad you have it working now, this is a significant point as it means there isn&#39;t a change that broke the event module during v8.4, the &quot;later v8.4 not working&quot; has been a bit of a red herring. The fact that it is a late&nbsp;&quot;low-write&quot; v8.4 and adding the code blocks resolves the issue confirms the original assumptions.</p>
<p>The &quot;low-write&quot; versions of emoncms weren&#39;t &quot;event module ready&quot; as&nbsp;the 2 code blocks are missing and there was no problem until the v8.5 changes were implemented..</p>

     <p>Hello friends<br />
I got here because I find that the events module emoncms no longer works and is a great pity<br />
I commented that I tested with several different Linux PC<br />
1) ubuntu 12.04 with 8.3 emoncms and events work.<br />
2) ubuntu 14.04 with emoncms 9RC2 not working. I get the message: &quot;Notice: Undefined index: order in /var/www/html/emoncms/Theme/basic/menu_view.php on line97&quot;<br />
3) ubuntu 14.04 with emoncms 9RC2 testing events and send messages but when trying to feed a receipt input &quot;Fatal error: Call to a member function get () on a non-object in / var / www / html / emoncms / Modules / event / event_model.php on line 238 &quot;<br />
4) Rasperry pi2 with emoncms downloaded image available and events work. In this case every time you add a new input is necessary to remove the module and add events to fly to work.</p>
<p>I am not an expert in emoncms, if a user interested. The module events is vital for many of us. Or is there another way to get emoncms advise us if something is wrong? Maybe I&#39;m missing something</p>
<p>I follow the thread with interest to see if they know they find a solution.<br />
I ask no way to dispose of emoncms 8.3.5 to install and so have the events?<br />
Where I can get the old versions of emoncms?<br />
Greetings to all</p>
