        <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="../user/10.html" title="View user profile.">glyn.hudson</a> on Sun, 10/04/2016 - 16:32</span>
        <div class="content"><p>The OpenEnergyMonitor website and Forum have been running (since 2010) on Drupal 6 (with applied security updates).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupal-6-eol">February 2016 Drupal 6 reached EOL</a>. This does not mean that the site will stop working. (As yet, it&#39;s going strong with 9783 users!) However, it does mean we need to look for future upgrade / migration paths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Web site building tools have advanced a bit in the 6 years since we first built OpenEnergyMonitor.&nbsp;We are considering all options, and will discuss any proposed action with the community. Nothing will change overnight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Website - building block etc.&nbsp;</h2>
<p>One option could be to use a static site generator such as Jekyll to auto convert markdown (stored on github) into static html. I have been using such a workflow to build a new Use Guide website (which is still in development) <a href="https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/">https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/</a>. The nice thing about github integration is how easy it is for users to submit corrections in the form of pull-requests. For example if you look at the <a href="http://guide.openenergymonitor.org/applications/solar-pv/">new (in dev) solar PV documentation page</a> on the new Guide website, you&#39;ll see a &#39;<a href="http://prose.io/#openenergymonitor/guide/blob/master/source/applications/solar-pv.markdown">Edit on Github Prose</a>&#39; link. This&nbsp;links to a rather nice markdown editor which incudes things like drag-and-drop images etc. All the existing Building block pages could be converted to static html and stored on github. This would have the added advantage of allowing a user to &#39;clone&#39; the whole site for reference&nbsp;offline. There are no plans (yet) to make the new Guide site I&#39;m working on the main OpenEnergyMonitor homepage. We are just exploring options, as well as building a (hopefully!) easy to follow user guide.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Forums&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The forums are the most active part of the site, and the part which requires the most attention e.g. fighting the constant SPAM war.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to propose moving the forums to a modern dedicated forum platform and changing the URL to community.openenergymonitor.org.</p>
<p>The open-source platform which has caught my eye is <a href="https://www.discourse.org/">https://www.discourse.org/</a></p>
<p>This is used by openHAB forums as well as <a href="http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/">many others</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://community.openhab.org/">https://community.openhab.org/</a>. &nbsp;Its seems moving to the Discourse forum was well received by the openHAB community. <a href="https://community.openhab.org/t/openhab-now-has-its-own-fully-fledged-discussion-forum/1449/5">Read thread here.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using a platform such as discourse would have advantages such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Better SPAM filtering</li>
<li>OAuth sign-in to enable users to quickly&nbsp;sign in with their&nbsp;Github / Google / Twitter account - easier, quicker, no additional passwords to remember and more secure. Also imports user profile + gravatar.</li>
<li>Better support for replying to posts on&nbsp;mobile devices&nbsp;</li>
<li>Improved search&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to @mention users like on GiitHub issues&nbsp;</li>
<li>Ability to mention other threads&nbsp;</li>
<li>Thread tagging e.g. solved, Arduino, Emoncms, etc.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Write&nbsp;in markdown with live preview&nbsp;</li>
<li>Forum will auto suggest possible threads to a user as a user starts to write a new post&nbsp;</li>
<li>Auto saving of responses - never lose a half-written reply again!&nbsp;</li>
<li>ability to bookmark posts / topics</li>
</ul>
<p>Another forum software option which caught my eye is&nbsp;<a href="http://flarum.org/">http://flarum.org/</a>, it looks very nice but not as established as Discourse.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I propose when we decide to make the shift we archive and freeze the current forum and start from fresh with the new forum. The old forum will be converted to a static site and will be searchable and retraceable.</p>
<p>This would obviously be a big change from the old forums we all love/hate. We are keen to get everyone on board before making any sweeping changes!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am interested to hear your thoughts, especially if anyone has experience using and administering Discourse forums.</p>

     <p>Hey Glyn, as a heavy openHAB forum user (but not involved with admin) I think the move to Discourse was a great decision. Unfortunately I had no involvement with the move itself but if you contact Thomas (<a href="https://community.openhab.org/users/teichsta/activity" title="https://community.openhab.org/users/teichsta/activity">https://community.openhab.org/users/teichsta/activity</a>) I am sure he would be happy to answer any questions.</p>

     <p>Have you guys looked at xenforo?</p>
<p>Another site I use has switched to this. It seems to have stopped spam almost completely and has a great interface. They completely redisgned things and it took about 3 months, although I understand a copy across would only have taken days.</p>

     <p>It would be good to capture other opinions and views about a replacement forum, as once it&#39;s changed, we will have to live with it for years to come!</p>
<p>Can we draw together a shortlist of suitable candidates?<br />

     <p>Xenforo is top grade but not free, you have to buy it</p>
<p>Discourse is unknown for me though I&#39;m a webjunky .... first time ever I hear that one ... seems to be free, why not install it somewhere and let us play/fool with it ? still best way to discover it for users and those that need to manage it.</p>
<p>Simple Machine Forums is pretty stable but slow evolution (not always bad)</p>
<p>PHPBB did some huge improvement but still has major spam issues</p>
<p>Vbulletin is now having a bad press since a few years though I liked it long time ago</p>
<p>invision seems rather nice also, not free but seems to run ok. Visit a forum with heavy traffic and it holds ...</p>
<p>That&#39;s about what I know, fooled around a lot with scripts a few years ago. What I learned ... look at evolution, actif support, quick response to bugs/security problems, actif members helping each other and most important, a good coder (ex PHPBB has a nasty habit crashing under heavy load, database wise)</p>

     <p>The phpBB spam issue can be resolved via the free (as in beer) script ZBBlock from spambotsecurity.com</p>
<p>We run it at aluminumalloyboats.com and have had <em><strong>zero</strong></em> spam for 2 years.</p>
<p>And yes, the improvements they&#39;ve made recently (v3.1) are very nice.</p>
<p>ZBBlock works with Drupal too. I made the suggestion regarding its use here, over a year ago, but for some reason, nothing came of it.</p>

     <p>Others interested to push the tests some more ? We have been only a few to test Discourse. Think most of us are convinced but being like 5 to test .... jump over and do some testing like we did. And don&#39;t be to serious about it, just push, click and post whatever and finally give your opinion ..&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Thanks for helping to test. I'm convinced it's the way to go. I spent most of today installing discourse onto our own server. It's been a bit of a epic involving docker and configuring nginx as a reverse proxy for our whole site since discourse does not work well with apache but we require apache to serve drupal php. Anyway.. I got there in the end. Once I finish setting up I'll migrate from the discourse hosted trial system to our own hosted instance then start sending out invites. I'll let you know when the self hosted version is ready. </p>
