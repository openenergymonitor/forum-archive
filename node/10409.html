                <h3 class="title" style="">EmonCMS in a Software as a Service Infrastructure</h3>
        <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="../user/3657.html" title="View user profile.">Mattia Rossi</a> on Mon, 30/03/2015 - 13:10</span>
        <div class="content"><p>Hello guys, long time no see, a new family member and a job switch has kept me away from (most&nbsp;of) the fun stuff.</p>
<p>I have been recently given the opportunity to connect what I do for a living (design software,network and hardware systems) and what I do when I want to have fun (play with cool stuff like arduino&nbsp;and emoncms):&nbsp;specifically I have been asked to evaluate costs and benefit of building a complete Software as a Service infrastructure with the specific goal of monitoring fleets of photovoltaic installations.</p>
<p>The current number of installations is about 6K, all of which would be retrofitted with a monitoring system that is able to post sensors data to an url, initially:</p>
<ul>
<li>PV production &nbsp;kWh counter</li>
<li>HOUSE consumption kWh counter</li>
<li>PV inverter status</li>
<li>temperatures</li>
<li>local energy diversion system state</li>
<li>possibly wheather data</li>
</ul>
<p>Since all of this data will probably have to be transmitted through mobile/gprs, sampling frequency will be between 1-15 min depending on gsm SIM data projected costs (no pseudo real time power reading, that is)</p>
<p>The system should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>gather sensors data</li>
<li>display aggregated data at various levels</li>
<li>react to events like inverter failure and trigger notifications</li>
<li>integrate power production and consumption data with local weather conditions</li>
<li>(in the future) act as the base for more detailed analitycs&nbsp;reasonings</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe that, with the correct approach, a modicum of new modules, and a lot of forward thinking and coding, emoncms could be one of the basic building blocks for such an infrastructure.</p>
<p>Specifically, I would like to try and use emoncms as the part that:</p>
<ul>
<li>collects data with single photovoltaic install granularity :
<ul>
<li>one user per site (and relative write apikey)</li>
<li>nodes preconfigured based on templates (the monitoring hardware will be uniform through the sites, but will undergo different revisions and could log more/less data depending on connectivity availability)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>displays such data to at least three levels of users (with different granularity):
<ul>
<li>fleet owners&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>​&nbsp;global data visualization&nbsp;(read only)</li>
<li>&nbsp;partners data&nbsp;breakdown and visualization&nbsp;(read only)</li>
<li>&nbsp;sites data breakdown and visualization&nbsp;(read only)</li>
<li>new partners/sites management</li>
<li>device/node management&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>partners/installers
<ul>
<li>partners data visualization</li>
<li>sites data breakdown&nbsp;(read only)</li>
<li>device/node setup/assignment to specific sites</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>site users/end clients
<ul>
<li>data visualization (read only)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>reacts to events and forwards alerts</li>
</ul>
<p>I know it would probably mean a lot of work, but in the eventuality that it moves from the thinking and prototipying stage to reality I would like to do it in &nbsp;such a way that benefits all users of the emoncms platform.</p>
<p>Things that I think would be necessary to handle all the listed functionality:</p>
<p>Emoncms:</p>
<ul>
<li>superuser module: a module that allows an admin/partner to
<ul>
<li>create new users and assign them to the appropriate (fleet/partner/site) category</li>
<li>associate specific&nbsp;hardware nodes (see below) to sites</li>
<li>handle hardware node maintenance: an admin should be able to enable/disable posting of sensor data from a data node depending on pre-set conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>supernode module: a module that allows the definition of specific nodes in terms of inputs and related processes:
<ul>
<li>hardware node: should reflect different versions/configurations of the hrdware doing the actual monitoring</li>
<li>collector node: should define the logic with which to pre-aggregate sensors reading at the partner/fleet level</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>custom frontend app module: should take care of correctly displaying data to various levels of users, would probably start from the mysolarpv&nbsp;view and expand on that</li>
</ul>
<p>At the moment I think emoncms could handle all the requirements except the visual analytics part (displaying data aggregated on variables like site installs, weather condition, pools of sites/partners ) for which emoncms would still be the provider of pre-computed data.</p>
<p>Data collection would be performed through either emonhub or a custom mqtt interface to emoncms, still undecided on that and will depend on the result of stress tests if/when we come to that</p>
<p>I am using this post as a general brainstorming session, mainly for myself ... I have been thinking/tinkering on how to shape it up using emoncms for a week now, and will probably start to play with basic versions of the superuser and supernode modules in the next week.</p>
<p>I have read other posts that discussed strategies for adding hierarchies of users to emoncms, but I honestly don&#39;t see how a hierarchical model could work using the actual interface, specifically I see no way of easily aggregating data if the single users have control on feeds and processes, and see no way (other that with an external app) of displaying in a secure way limited amount of information</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have been thinking a lot about system requirements, both in terms of storage and in terms of connectivity, will probably post my reasonings in another message</p>
<p>All modules developed for this purpose would naturally be shared with&nbsp;&nbsp;the community, and this would apply to the frontend, if it turns out to be feasible to keep everything in sync with emoncms development.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please&nbsp;keep in mind that as of now everything is still at the design level, and all of this exists only in my mind (and on a couple of test installations on AWS :) )</p>
<p>Wil keep updating as soon as I have more specifics.</p>

     <p>Hello Mattia, this sounds like a really interesting project and great to hear that your considering using emoncms. I can see these features being useful for quite a few people installing systems in this way. I think <a href="../user/877.html">Ildefonso Mart&iacute;nez</a> may have been working on something similar. Very interested to hear how this develops, I&#39;ve also got a cloud focused version of emoncms in the works with the option to have as many storage servers as you need as well as a more streamlined input stage which may be of interest as you get to the numbers of sites your talking about.</p>

     <p>Hi, sorry for the late reply,</p>
<p>in these two weeks I have been experimenting more with backend options, the frontend (and the user module) are for the moment still in the planning department (s.g. some ideas in my head :)<br />
Unfortunately the time I am able to dedicate to this project is small, so I am procedding, but at a really slow pace.</p>
<p>I have evaluated/experimented with a couple of options regarding storage, specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>using the existing storage technology, augmented by MQTT and mqttwarn to pre-aggregate data based on static logic: fairly easy to implement, but unflexible and even more taxing with regards to storage and system requirements</li>
<li>adding an aggregation layer using a Module, not so easy to create a flexible enough solution, probably would incur in performance issues pretty soon</li>
<li>adding an additional storage engine like InfluxDB (<a href="http://influxdb.com/" title="http://influxdb.com/">http://influxdb.com/</a>) that in its latest incarnation has the concept of tags and would allow for queries like</li>
</ul>
<p>SELECT mean(prod_kwh),mean(kw),mean(solar_kwh) FROM /emoncms.feed_*/<br />
WHERE substr(geohash,1,6) = &#39;dr5ru4&#39;<br />
&nbsp; AND company =&#39;ACME&#39;<br />
&nbsp; AND installer = &#39;installer1&#39;<br />
&nbsp; AND time &gt; now() - 4h<br />
GROUP BY time(5m), *</p>
<p>Influxdb has support for graphite style data posting (that I have used for my experiments since there was some experimental support in emoncms), but in order to be able to use the tagging feature I would need to write an engine that speaks directly to the InfluxDb API</p>
<p>For the frontend, I am way behind schedule, and my experiments have been focused in toying with the myelectric and mysolarpv app in order to display additional data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next on my todo list is to think/experiment with the user hierarchy/model. Will keep you guys updated</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>@Trystan-Glynn: Is it too soon to request a 868 Mhz version of the emonpi ? Got me one the day the kickstarter project started :)</p>
