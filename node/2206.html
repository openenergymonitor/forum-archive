        <div class="content"><p>I&#39;ve built the controller using the design &amp; boards from here</p>
<p><a href="2044.html" title="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/2044">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/2044</a></p>
<p>and&nbsp;have tested the controller using the input from a 500W lamp to simulate the PV and a 3 KW kettle to simulate the load. I&#39;ve run the voltage&nbsp;calibration and phase calibration checks and everything seems to be working fine and as I wrap extra turns around the CT to increase the simulated PV, the rate of&nbsp;triac&nbsp;firing increases.</p>
<p>The problem which I can&#39;t figure out is that&nbsp;the triac is firing with no simulated PV. IT fires even if I disconnect the CT.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the Mk2i PV Router Rev4 sketch in free running mode and the&nbsp;system is behaving the same in both&nbsp;normal and anti flicker mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#39;m reasonably confident that the controller has been built correctly, but I&#39;m scratching my head ( again)</p>
<p>Any ideas please ?</p>

     <p>Are you simulating the load &amp; P.V exactly as in the drawing here: <a href="https://learn.openenergymonitor.org?redirect=mk2/build" title="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/mk2/build">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/mk2/build</a></p>
<p>If you are not measuring the nett current, the control loop is not closed and the triac will continue to fire. That is the most likely explanation.</p>

     <p>You could try running any of my Mk2a or Mk2i sketches in Tallymode.&nbsp; This will give you a good idea of whether the measurement side of the system is working correctly. You will also be able to calibrate your system accurately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until the measurement side is known to be working correctly, I wouldn&#39;t connect any dump load.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>OK, tried a number of things ...</p>
<p>with the CT unconnected and transformer unpowered I get 2.5V on pins 1,2 &amp; 3 of the LM358.</p>
<p>with the transformer powered at 240v I get 10.2v across the 150K &amp; 15K resistors in series and 0.7v across the 15K resistor.</p>
<p>with the CT unconnected or shorted I am getting 0v on the voltmeter and&nbsp;using the rawsamples tool, the ADC values are centered at 509 ~ 511.</p>
<p>Voltage readings are spread nicely from 186 to 835 in the raw samples tool.</p>
<p>Using tallymode in mk2i rev4, I had to adjust powercal to 0.021 to get a sensible reading from a 500w light bulb as my known source. Using a 60w light bulb powercal it needed to be 0.01. I have kept a value of 0.021.</p>
<p>With the phasecal tool,&nbsp;even numbers around 3 or 4 are only giving a power factor of 0.4 for my 500w light bulb, which I would have thought was a purely resistive load (?). I have kept phasecal at 1.</p>
<p>I have tried running the bench test again with mk2i rev4 and I am getting the same results. I am certain I have set up the CT correctly,&nbsp;measuring the net current. As I increase the simulated PV load, (60 w&nbsp;lamp) by adding more turns, the&nbsp;rate of triac firing increases but triac firing continues with the pv load switched off.</p>
<p>thoughts again ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

     <p>I ran phasecal tool with a 3kw heater and it needed a phasecal of 10 to get a power factor of 0.92.</p>
<p>Using the raw samples tool, a 60w light bulb as a resistive load showed a small but discernable&nbsp;variation in the CT output, a 500w light bulb&nbsp;gave a full&nbsp;spread wave form but the 3kw heater seemed to overload the CT, sending values from 0 to 1023 with only 1 or 2, non extreme readings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CT is OK as I have plugged it into emontx and it is giving good readings. Is it likely to be the&nbsp;LM358, too much gain ?</p>

<p>You need to <u>reverse</u> the CT on the wire to empty the bucket, simulating export. What you are doing with the CT is not simulating PV, but home consumption and if you are importing or exporting.</p>
<p>Even I did the same thing till the penny dropped!</p>

     <p>thanks Robin, fitted the 150R resistor and everything is working on the test bench as it should be. Power factor 1 on a resistive load, current and voltage traces evenly spread, phasecal now set to 1 and powercal at 0.08.</p>
<p>I am using the SCT 013 CT and for some reason I was under the impression it was fitted with a burden resistor so didn&#39;t fit the additional one ... but I have now.</p>
<p>On to the next step ....... I notice in one of your videos you have a changeover switch for solar to constant. Are you using a mains relay ?</p>
<p>And I might do battle again&nbsp;with IP addresses to get the nanode talking to emoncms ....</p>

     <p>Yes, the CT really does need a burden resistor, otherwise there&#39;s nothing to develop a voltage across for the Arduino to measure at its ADC input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the standard YHDC CT, and a 150R burden, the full scale of your measurement system should be around 4 kW, which is fine for most PV systems.&nbsp; If you wanted to measure the consumption of an entire house, your burden would need to be correspondingly smaller.&nbsp; A burden of 18R sets the full-scale value at around 25 kW.</p>
<p>No, there&#39;s no relay, just two switches in parallel in the Live path; one manual and the other electronic.&nbsp; The triac doesn&#39;t seem to mind working in this way.&nbsp;</p>

     <p>A <em><strong>current</strong></em> transformer behaves as a <em><strong>current</strong></em> source. That means (subject to its power rating) that it will generate whatever voltage is necessary to drive the current it needs to - in the case of the 100 A: 50 mA one, one 2-thousandth of the load current. If the ADC had a current input, that wouldn&#39;t be a problem. As it is, the ADC input is a voltage input and it needs the burden resistor to convert that current into a voltage.</p>
<p>It&#39;s quite possible that you can damage or destroy the Arduino analogue input if you leave off the burden resistor. A large c.t. when open-circuited can easily generate many thousands of volts and destroy itself by flashing over, not to mention the danger to anyone near. NEVER, ever, open-circuit a current transformer.</p>

<p>Good to hear you have the right numbers now, Were you using the SCT 013 000, not the SCT 013 030? (that has a built in burden),</p>
<p>It actually takes quite a lot to over stress a CT, if you have a 30A CT set up it may give a distorted O/P with a higher current, but in this application all it needs to do is tell what way the current is going and if there is enough surplus to fire the triac.</p>

<p>The problem with a distorted output is that it is likely to be non-linear, getting progressively worse as the signal size increases.&nbsp; A Mk2-type system will only be able to balance consumption and generation accurately if everything is linear.&nbsp; When surplus PV is minimal or near maximum, the disparity of the energy content between mains cycles when the load is &#39;on&#39; and &#39;off&#39; is considerable, maybe 50:1 or greater.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the Eco Eye monitor, the voltage sensor is indeed only used to show which way the current is going.&nbsp; That product assumes a standard value for the voltage so will be somewhat less accurate than any system which uses a measured value.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The maximum phase error of 3&ordm; is insignificant (representing a power factor error of less than 0.0015).</em></p>
<p>That&#39;s only true for resistive loads right? &nbsp;i.e. cos 3 / cos 0 is pretty close to 1. &nbsp; But as the load gets closer to being purely reactive cos 88 / cos 85 is a long way from 1.</p>
<p>One of the things for which I use my system (which admittedly has a lot more dynamic range than&nbsp;emontx) is baseload tuning; answering questions like &quot;Is it worth turning my microwave off at the wall?&quot;. &nbsp;You can see in the attached screenshot when it&#39;s just being a clock, it&#39;s almost purely reactive. &nbsp;An un-checked&nbsp;3&ordm; phase error there would be quite significant.</p>

<p>Indeed, especially if your background load is a nice reactive mix. &nbsp;My party trick is to demonstrate how my currentcost display will&nbsp;<strong>drop&nbsp;</strong>by about 30W just by turning my microwave <strong>on</strong> at the wall. &nbsp; Alas, it only works when the fridge is running. &nbsp;The currentcost counts the fridge&#39;s reactive power as real, and the microwave&#39;s capacitors help correct the fridge&#39;s inductor. &nbsp;Measuring current without reference to V is pretty useless in most cases.</p>
<p>It spawned a dodgy market in power factor correcting devices here. &nbsp; Amazingly our consumer regulator managed to get their heads around it enough to shut them down:</p>

     <p>The most power I&#39;ve seen drawn from the grid as measured by the Eco Eye software was around 7.5KW, this was the washing machine, dishwasher and the wifes hair drier. Not thankfully a normal occurrence so using just I=p/v&nbsp; thats around the saturation point of the CT, is it a problem? I don&#39;t think&nbsp;it is&nbsp;as I have a 4KW max solar system so in any case the Mk2 would not be attempting to divert, Would I be right in assuming anything over about 17A is irrelevant as thats the max the PV will o/p? Or would it be anything over 12.5A (what the immersion draws) assuming good sunlight and not much else going on so the triac will be fully on and still exporting power to the grid?</p>
<p><em>&quot;It actually takes quite a lot to over stress a CT, if you have a 30A CT set up&quot;</em>&nbsp; What I meant by this is that you aren&#39;t likely to to be drawing anywhere&nbsp;30A at any one time, I do appreciate the importance of a good signal but as 4KW of PV or so seems to be the norm the diverter would be off. Does that sound right?</p>

     <p>Under &#39;normal&#39; loads with &#39;normal&#39; power factors, 3&deg; is indeed insignificant, but of course it does become significant at poor power factors (almost purely reactive loads). However, those loads tend to be very small so the overall effect still is it makes little difference.

<p>I once questioned one of the manufacturers of an &quot;approximate&quot; device: they admitted it multiplied current by a constant voltage and assumed unity power factor.

     <p><em>What&#39;s the reasoning there?</em></p>
<p>The supply is generally inductive, so adding a capacitor will &quot;correct&quot; the power factor (to the suppliers benefit, not yours!) and it&#39;s heading towards resonance so the voltage will rise. You can soon see the effect if you throw a handful of components - a voltage generator, a series resistor and inductor representing the supply, and a load resistor with or without a parallel capacitor - at your favourite circuit simulation program. This is how dip compensators work.</p>
<p>I have but one comment about the phase errors in your case: If you have a system with that kind of resolution, you should be looking at measurement grade current transformers at the very minimum, most probably ring-core c.t&#39;s, and not cheap split-core ones. And the same goes for the voltage transformer(s). If you can&#39;t do that, then you also need to consider the variation of the phase errors with load (for the c.t.) and system voltage (for the v.t.), and possibly correct for that variation too.</p>

     <p>Actually, on the V side I use a precision divider and it all sits behind isolators that are good for 2.5kV, but yes, the overall system accuracy is only as good as its weakest link. &nbsp;The trick is to find CTs with a nice flat amplitude error and phase error over a broad current range (and temperature range). &nbsp;That and use an upmarket power calibrator where you can independently control V, I and&nbsp;&Oslash; (that&#39;s the bit that gets expensive).</p>

     <p>The &#39;test&#39; impedance (I read that as the general worst-case) for a single phase supply for flicker is (0.24 + j 0.15)Ω in the line and (0.16 + j 0.10) Ω in the neutral at 240 V (you can of course lump the two together for this exercise). If you put those values into your simulation, add a representative resistive load, then add some parallel capacitance, you should see the voltage across the load rise. Of course, if your supply has a very high fault level, i.e. the impedance is lower than the test one, the effect will be much less than if it&#39;s marginal.</p>
<p>You won&#39;t of course achieve resonance - I wrote &quot;<em>towards</em> resonance&quot;.</p>
<p>What Robin is saying is when he switches a dump load on and off, by virtue of the impedance of the supply, there is an additional voltage drop across that supply impedance and it causes the voltage you see to &quot;dip&quot;. Repeated, frequently, it&#39;s called &quot;flicker&quot;. What I&#39;m saying is were that load to include sufficient parallel capacitance (and generally that&#39;s not practical but stay with the idea), then because the supply is inductively reactive, the interaction with the capacitive reactance you add can exactly cancel the voltage dip.</p>
<p>If you can see the power apparently reduce when you add a capacitive load, does it not mean that you aren&#39;t measuring the true real power in the first place? Sorry, but I think there is a reactive component in the quantity that you&#39;re measuring.</p>

     <p>Yes, as Robert has mentioned, I was simply pointing out that the local mains voltage will move slightly up and down as a relatively high-power load is turned off &amp; on.&nbsp; This is despite being connected to the low-impedance grid.&nbsp; Various regulations exist which limit the amount of permitted flicker, and there has been much talk in these parts (and indeed some action too!) about this thorny topic.</p>

     <p><em>Ah, I&#39;d lost track and thought that you were saying that your hi-res monitor did it.</em></p>
<p>That would be a worry, given its revenue-grade roots.</p>
<p><em>I totally understand why the &#39;el cheapo&#39; breeds tell lies.</em></p>
<p>Yes, I only dusted off my old currentcost anecdote in response to richmc&#39;s bold claim that &quot;in this application all it needs to do is tell what way the current is going and if there is enough surplus to fire the triac&quot;. &nbsp;If that&#39;s all PV-dump were doing, I doubt it would come close to nailing that spinning disk meter like it does, especially when the background load is a nice reactive mix.</p>
<p><em>I was simply pointing out that the local mains voltage will move slightly up and down as a relatively high-power load is turned off &amp; on.&nbsp; This is despite being connected to the low-impedance grid.</em></p>
<p>Fair enough. &nbsp;Your &quot;judging by the amount of interest&quot; comment was too cryptic for me to connect the dots. &nbsp;I can imagine rapid fire switching of a&nbsp;3kW&nbsp;load could be problematic. &nbsp;The load being switched in my currentcost party trick is way way smaller (~3W real, 60VAR reactive). &nbsp;So while the physics might dictate that a response will show up on V, in reality it&#39;s lost in the soup of Vgrid.</p>
<p>But speaking of grid impedance, it does show up as an issue here but typically in the other direction. &nbsp;Because we only get paid if we export our PV, the winning strategy here is to turn everything off except the fridge, send everyone off to work/school and run all your discretionary loads at night. &nbsp; On a sunny day this can result in areas of quite large production with very little consumption. &nbsp;Throw in a bit of grid impedance and before you know it inverters start hitting their Vmax trip-points... typically in the mid to high 260&#39;s. &nbsp;Voltage regulation on the grid seems to be very &quot;chunky&quot; and not very fast.</p>
