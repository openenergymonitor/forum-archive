        <div class="content"><p>I&#39;m a noob to emonTx so thanks to everyone for their contributions to getting the project this far.</p>
<p>I have seen a few libraries and sketches&nbsp;posted on the forums and github: DiscreteSampling&nbsp;(Trystan), ContinuousPLL (Martin), ContinuousFree (Robin), ContinuousPLL&nbsp;flexible (Nuno), etc. &nbsp;What I have noticed in all of these is that there is no standard foundation of common objects and methods. &nbsp;In this post, I propose we take steps to standardize the most basic and common ways of processing an ADC sample and calculating power. &nbsp;Regulating this to a library helps de-clutter code of higher-level sketches and reduces the amount of code that has to be repeated for each ADC channel or CT.</p>
<p>My proposal is for an energy monitor firmware&nbsp;to have three layers: (1) Standard Object/Method Library, (2) Process Library, (3) Sketch with setup() and loop(). &nbsp;For example, in this scheme, the standard firmware would be comprised of&nbsp;(1) the proposed&nbsp;object library, (2) EmonLib, (3) DiscreteSampling.</p>
<p>I have attached a very rough draft of what the new object library could look like. &nbsp;(The only testing I have done is that it compiles, so keep this in mind) &nbsp;You will notice that the concept is object-oriented in a way that I have not seen anywhere. &nbsp;In a&nbsp;sketch using this library, a&nbsp;user defines an array to describe which ADC channels are used and what they are for (CT or VT). &nbsp;Then, the user&nbsp;constructs an Emon object, that contains CT and VT objects and the methods for computing power. &nbsp;This library should contain&nbsp;all standard methods needed for processing ADC samples and calculating&nbsp;power. &nbsp;Also, this library should be generic enough to be used by libraries/sketches, regardless of the process or approach (Discrete, continuous, PLL, etc).</p>
<p>With an object-oriented approach, it&#39;s possible that there is a time cost&nbsp;that the existing sketches/libraries does not have. &nbsp;This would have to be tested to characterize what the cost in time is to using an approach such as this. &nbsp;Maybe this is why nobody is doing it this way?</p>
<p>At this stage, I&#39;m soliciting the community for whether an approach of standardizing&nbsp;basic energy monitoring functions would be supported. &nbsp;If so, we can begin collaborating on the best way to achieve this.</p>
