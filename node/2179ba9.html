      <div class="content"><p>&nbsp;I have used the 2 channel non invasive sketch, to build a device which monitors how much power is being used in the home, and how much &nbsp;power is being generated by the solar panels. If I am generating more than I am currently using, then the excess power is diverted to an immersion heater - to heat domestic hot water. This is a better option than it flowing back to the grid for which I don't get paid (solar renta roof).</p>
<p>This was a steep learning curve as I have never worked with a microprocessor before, but great fun and a great sense of acheivement when it actually works!</p>
<p><img alt="PCB" width="600" height="401" src="http://error404.000webhost.com/?" /></p>
<p>The first version was built on a Arduino Uno board, with the input components mounted on veroboard, but then I decided to build it as a standalone, with everything on one board.<br />
The LCD is reclaimed from an old alarm keypad, and I had a USB panel socket laying about so I used that for the 4 CT input connections. (did I mention that I am a Yorkshireman...)</p>
<p>As the peak solar &nbsp;power generation is 3.5kw, I used a shunt resistor to range up to 5kw, but fitted clamping &nbsp;diodes (Glyn's idea - see forum) to ensure that the mains usage did not exceed 5kw and damage the Atmega chip.</p>
<p><img alt="fitted in box" width="600" height="439" src="http://error404.000webhost.com/?" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>With a bit of sawing and hacking, managed to fit the PCB into a Maplins project box.</p>
<p><img alt="power readings" width="600" height="386" src="http://error404.000webhost.com/?" /></p>
<p>Here you can see the power results, which if less than 1kw displays in watts, otherwise kw's.</p>
<p>The tiny LED is multi function and indicates;</p>
<p>1) flashing every 4 seconds - indicates that the unit is functioning, but not enough solar power to activate either relay.<br />
2) steady but lit 25% - indicates that 500w is being unused, and activates relay 1, with a diode in series to limit the load to 500w (yes it does work, I've done the sums on the leccy meter!)<br />
3) steady but lit brightly - indicates that in excess of 1kw is being unused, switches off relay 1 and activates relay 2 which delivers a full kw (which is the rating of the immersion heater).</p>
<p>The button is a menu navigator, and switches between displays (copied from another project).</p>
<p><img alt="kwh" width="600" height="399" src="http://error404.000webhost.com/?" /><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This display shows how much power is generated within a 24hr period, before resetting back to zero at midnight. There is no external timing here, just a simple millis() counter which resets every 24hrs. On startup, the counter resets after 12hrs for one occassion ( so if it's powered up at midday, it will &nbsp;reset at midnight and every midnight thereafter.</p>
<p><img width="600" height="399" alt="" src="http://error404.000webhost.com/?" /></p>
<p>This display shows voltage and power factor, which of course is needed for calibration purposes.<br />
To calibrate it, I took the readings from the LCD, removed the chip and wrote the new sketch via a Arduino Uno board, before replacing it in the standalone.</p>
<p>The sketch is posted <a href="http://bit.ly/p0QhTE">here</a>&nbsp;, please feel free to make any suggestions or create a new version of the paste in pastebin., and although a new guy to Arduino's/programming, if I can help, please email me at (the last word in bold in this post) <strong>@gmail.com</strong></p>
<p>Sketch has also been uploaded to OpenEnergyMonitor. Download it <a href="../sites/default/files/SolarEnergyMonitor.html">here</a></p>
<h2>...UPDATE 7th Sept</h2>
<p>Following Glyn's advice (in comments below) I have built a Nanode, and have connected both units via their Rx/Tx serial bus, and use a simple Serial.print statement in the above device, to be decoded in the Nanode by the CmdMessenger library.</p>
<p>Data is then <a href="http://bit.ly/nADmAo">uploaded to Pachube</a> every 20seconds by the Nanode, provided that the data values have changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

     <p>Hey that's a really good idea which will solve the problem I have.  My PV connects to the existing consumer unit, so while I can measure PV current (inside the consumer unit) and grid current (meter tail), I can't measure house current so have the problem of working out the direction of the grid current.  I had been thinking about comparing its phase with the PV current, but much simpler is just to put the PV feed through the CT on a meter tail, thus giving me house current (grid current minus PV current).</p>

     <p>To keep the supplies seperate, I fitted a Henley block close to the electric meter, and fed a fresh pair if tails from the block directly into a dual gang consumer unit, which in turn powered the immersion heater. This Henley block also joined the feed from the solar invertor. So I could easily isolate and pick up on any of the tails before they were joined in the block.</p>
<p>If it helps, <a href="http://error404.000webhost.com/?">here is the front-end circuitry</a>, and you will note the 2 clamping diodes to ensure that over/under voltage doesn't damage the chip. I felt that this was important as I have used a high value burdon resistor to read only 0 - 5kW (as I have a 3.5kW solar panels).</p>
<p>As regards the veroboard layout, I sketched it out rough on some graph paper and made a few tweeks as I commenced the build, for example; I wanted a vertical variable resistor, but could only get a horizontal on the day, so had to shoehorn it in. I also found that I had a little more space so I added a bit of space to allow future amendments. But <a href="http://error404.000webhost.com/?">here is a scan of the sketch</a> if it helps. If you look at the sketch and then look at the photos of the PCB I'm sure you will figure it out.</p>

     <p>Thanks Paul, thats a great help, I'm going to totally rebuild now! but I will keep the Triac as my control method, I run it as low as 200 watts, which on a dull day still gives me a reasonable amount of hot water!<br />
Anyway, thanks again for the drawings SK</p>
