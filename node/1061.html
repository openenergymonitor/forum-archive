        <div class="content"><p>The Mk2 PV Controller that I and others are now using relies on the small amount of leeway that is available when using a digital supply meter, such as the Landis 5235A.&nbsp; This allows surplus PV energy to be temporarily stored in the grid before being reclaimed without penalty for consumption by the dump load.&nbsp; While surplus power is being routed in this way, the amount of energy passing to and fro through the meter is just one or two mains cycles&#39; worth, i.e. around 100J with a 3kW dump load.&nbsp; This is well within the 3600J window of flexibility that a digital meter allows.</p>
<p>Once PV has been installed, the supply meter should no longer be able to turn backwards.&nbsp; One way for the supplier to achieve this is for a disc meter to be equipped with a mechanical device which prevents it from going backwards.&nbsp; In order to cater for non-resistive loads and the like, there must presumably be limited ability for such a meter to unwind.&nbsp; Maybe it can go backwards for half a turn, or a whole turn.</p>
<p>It would be really helpful to know how such a meter behaves.&nbsp; On a day when there is surplus PV, a good series of tests would be:</p>
<p>1. Apply a high power load so that the meter is clearly in consumption mode.&nbsp; Then, when the disc-marker is visible, cut the load.&nbsp; Question: how far does the disc unwind before being stopped by the mechanical endstop?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Arrange for the disc marker to be visible when the meter is sitting against the backstop (house exporting).&nbsp; Briefly apply a high power load and then turn it off again.&nbsp; Question: after the meter has briefly advanced, does it return to the same resting point?&nbsp; I trust that it will do.</p>
<p>3. Repeat test 2, but with the load being applied for longer durations.&nbsp; Question: for how long can the load be applied before the endstop position is affected?&nbsp; The answer really needs to be in Joules, with 0.001kWh being 3600J.&nbsp; Maybe this corresponds to one revolution of the disc?</p>
<p>Hope someone can help ...</p>

<p>I believe most such meters carry the calibration on the face: mine says &quot;187.5 rev/kWh&quot;.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I next get the car out, I&#39;ll take a close look at my meter (it has a transparent case) and I might be able to see the ratchet mechanism.</p>
<p>I really think all the accumulated knowledge on this site about electricity meters ought to be collated into one article. Does anyone share that view? Would it be useful?</p>

     <p>I&#39;d appreciate that Robert, I&#39;m new to all this I have a Landis &amp; Gyr meter (5258 I think) that was recently installed as my old disc meter was merrly going backwards, I know nothing about how these beasts work. I&#39;ve just got an Eco Eye Smart PV, this is telling me that I&#39;m importing &amp; exporting whilst my Mk2 is heating water, now I trust that the Mk2 is working faster than the meter so I&#39;m not actually importing and that the smart PV is not mimicking the meter but working much faster, a matter that I&#39;ve e-mailed Eco Eye with, as yet no reply. It would be good if someone with the knowledge could confirm that all is in order.</p>

     <p>While the LED on my digital supply meter remains &#39;on&#39;, I feel confident that I&#39;m not being charged.&nbsp; Because Mk2 maintains a zero net flow of energy at the supply point, our meter soon enters its &#39;anti-creep&#39; mode whereby its registers are no longer updated until any significant amount of consumption occurs.</p>
<p>With a non-reversing analogue (disc) meter, the acid test is presumably whether the disc moves forward or not while Mk2 is doing its thing.&nbsp; Because a disc meter doesn&#39;t have a lockdown mode, I would expect the dial to drift very slowly one way or the other when Mk2 is in operation.&nbsp; Varying<em><strong> safetyMargin_watts</strong></em> should have a linear effect on the speed of drift.&nbsp; With this value set to, say, 50W, I would expect the dial to slowly drift <em>backwards</em> until the mechanical end-stop has been reached.&nbsp; With it set to -50W, I would expect the dial to drift <em>forwards</em> at a rate corresponding to around 50W.</p>
<p>If forward movement of the dial can&#39;t be halted by this means, then that would be a problem.&nbsp; Such an outcome would mean that the technique of temporarily lodging surplus energy in the grid doesn&#39;t work with disc-style meters.&nbsp; With no more than 100J flowing to and fro, I would be most surprised if that behaviour was unacceptable to the non-reversing mechanism.</p>

     <p>My meter is of this type...</p>
<p>i had a unlimited reverse rotation disc type meter prior to PV.. &nbsp;which was 187.5 rev per kw...<br />
	then it was replaced with another disc meter, rated at 200 rev per kw.</p>
<p>it now however only goes back about half a turn..before stopping.</p>
<p>there are 2 stop points, one near the zero marker, one near the 4 marker.. &nbsp;so not exactly half a turn...<br />
	one is a bit &nbsp;more, the other a bit less.</p>
<p>when testing my SSR&nbsp;+ arduino&nbsp;i had it set to a 2 second on, 5 second off duty cycle...<br />
	and as you would expect... it went forward to 2seconds... and then backwards for 5 seconds :)</p>
<p>until it either hit the stop point (so indicating&nbsp;i&#39;m&nbsp;losing energy to the grid...)<br />
	or until the next 2 second on cycle, &nbsp;depending on how much sun is shining..</p>
<p>i had previously tested it with a kettle on an extension lead...(as the meter is outside.)<br />
	and i played around with the kettle switch cycling the power on and off...much to the amusement of the postman and the meter reader (who i&#39;d never seen before) who both gave me very odd looks..</p>
<p>so for my meter.. half a rev.. is about 2.5w/h leeway i guess.</p>

     <p><em>richd: so for my meter.. half a rev.. is about 2.5w/h leeway i guess.</em></p>
<p>Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp; 2.5Wh is over twice as much flexibility as our digital meter allows.&nbsp; This suggests that the Mk2 philosophy should work fine with disc meters (phew!)</p>
<p><em>richmc: Shameless beg, does anyone know anything about my Landis &amp; Gyr meter 5258? Mainly what the LED should be doing during import, export, and no flow and what does it mean&nbsp;as it&#39;s flashing.</em></p>
<p>The manual doesn&#39;t help much for our Landis 5235 either.&nbsp; However, this is how it appears to work:</p>
<p>When consuming power, the LED flashes every 0.001kWh, or 3600J.&nbsp; As an aside, the flash duration is around 38mS, and can be easily detected using my cut-down &#39;mini&#39; Mk2 code.&nbsp; Being able to detect meter pulses is really useful for calibrating your setup.</p>
<p>When exporting power, the LED is constantly on.</p>
<p>If the net flow of power through the meter drops below around 12W for some minutes, it goes into &#39;anti-creep&#39; mode which (unhelpfully for us) is indicated by the LED being constantly on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now for the fun bit.&nbsp; Having been charged for some <strike>power</strike> energy (pulse seen), if the meter falls back below that same level, the LED goes on.&nbsp; It stays on until it&#39;s next time for you to be charged at which point it goes off.&nbsp; On to off transitions are chargeable events.&nbsp; If the level drops by less than 0.001kWh after the LED goes on, then that&#39;s fine - no energy is lost.&nbsp; But if it drops too far, some energy is permanently lost to the grid - you&#39;ve exported it for no gain and it&#39;s no longer freely available for your use.&nbsp; When energy is next drawn from the grid, the LED will go off &#39;sooner&#39; than it did before.&nbsp; You&#39;ve essentially been charged again for the same packet of energy.&nbsp; Providing that the packets of energy are sufficiently small, i.e well within the 0.001kWh window, the same energy can pass to and fro endlessly without being charged for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can see all this in action by uncommenting the two lines which contain <em>energyInBucket_4led </em>just after the &quot;WARNING&quot; statement in my cut-down Mk2 code.&nbsp; This will display the amount of power flowing each second in either direction.&nbsp; Simple experiments with a suitable load should show exactly how your meter works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If a kettle seems rather naff, how about an angle grinder.&nbsp; That should keep the postman at bay ...</p>

<p>Robin, does this mean that old disc type meters could have a larger energy bucket than 3600J ?</p>
<p>Would there be any benefit to this?&nbsp; Perhaps evening out spikes in load a little?</p>

     <p><em>stuart: does this mean that old disc type meters could have a larger energy bucket than 3600J ?</em></p>
<p>Yes, I suppose that it does.&nbsp; My value of 1800J really shouldn&#39;t be regarded as a key parameter.&nbsp; Any number will do.&nbsp; It&#39;s simply a threshold above which the triac is turned on, and below which it isn&#39;t.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The upper half of the energy bucket simply serves as an overflow.&nbsp; If there was no overflow, the bucket would fill up to some huge value after the thermostat had tripped, and the algorithm would then attempt to consume all that (chargeable) energy after the water had cooled.</p>
<p>Having min and max limits of 0J and 3600J respectively feels right to me because this replicates my understanding of how digital meters work.&nbsp; Mk2 needs a range of around 200J max to do its thing.&nbsp; This is well within the zone of tolerance in all known types of meter.&nbsp; The nominal capacity of the bucket is of no importance so long as it&#39;s sufficiently large to accommodate that range.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If calibration is way out, then each &#39;on&#39; cycle of the dump load will be seen to consume something other than 60W.&nbsp; If the system is out by a factor of three, then Mk2&#39;s operation will nominally cover a 600J range.&nbsp; With a bucket having a nominal capacity of 3600J, there is considerable tolerance of poor calibration.</p>
<p>None of these absolute values have the slightest effect once distribution of power has got under way.&nbsp; What <strong><em>does</em></strong> matter, however, is the system&#39;s <strong><em>linearity</em></strong>.&nbsp; More on this to follow on your <a href="1059.html">transformerless thread</a> ...</p>
