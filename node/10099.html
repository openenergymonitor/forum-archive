        <span class="submitted">Submitted by <a href="/emon/user/956" title="View user profile.">calypso_rae</a> on Thu, 29/01/2015 - 11:45</span>
        <div class="content"><p>During the last couple of years, several forms of my single-phase &quot;Mk2&quot; surplus power diverter have appeared on this forum.&nbsp; This code can be run on various standard platforms such as the Arduino Uno or the emonTx.&nbsp; More recently, I have developed my own PCB-based hardware which is available via my website at <a href="http://www.mk2pvrouter.co.uk">www.mk2pvrouter.co.uk</a></p>
<p>I have also developed a PCB which allows full monitoring of energy flow within a 3-phase environment.&nbsp; In a 3-phase environment, the user is generally charged for their net consumption across all three phases.&nbsp; By having just one processor which knows about the flow of energy on all of the phases, any surplus power can be accurately assessed and diverted for some useful on-site purpose.</p>
<p>3-phase diverter code of this type has been successfully running in the field for some months.&nbsp; From today, that code is available via the Downloads page of my website, and a copy is attached to this post.</p>
<p>This code is intended to be run on my 3-phase PCB, details of which can be found on the <a href="http://mk2pvrouter.co.uk/61101.html">3-phase page</a> of my website.&nbsp; With a separate dual-secondary mains transformer for each phase, this PCB avoids the need for any extra adapters.&nbsp; A circuit diagram for this PCB is attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This 3-phase code could also be run on any Arduino-type platform which provides access to all six of the analog ports on the Atmega 328 processor.&nbsp; Because the emonTx only has a single sensor for AC voltage, this code is not suitable for that platform.</p>
<p>My 3-phase diverter code has its roots in various single-phase &quot;Mk2&quot; sketches.&nbsp; The 6-way sampling sequence is an extension of the 3-way one that&#39;s in Mk2i_rev6 where an extra analog channel was used to measure the amount of current that has been diverted.&nbsp; The ability to control multiple loads has been taken from Mk2i_rev5 including the single-threshold AF algorithm which is well suited to a multi-load environment.&nbsp; The RF datalogging mechanism is similar to that in Mk2i_rev6.&nbsp; Average power and Vrms data for each phase is regularly sent to the Serial monitor, but is only transmitted by RF if the literal RF_PRESENT is included.</p>
<p>This code is based on the premise that 3-phase users are charged according to their net use of power across all three phases.&nbsp; As with its single-phase equivalent, the 3-phase diverter relies on there being a small range (aka &quot;sweet-zone&quot;) where energy can move to and fro across the supply meter without penalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
