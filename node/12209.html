     <p>Any clues as to what system&nbsp;you are running? emonhub and emoncms versions, image or self-built? Is the OS read-only?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The data above is 14mins&nbsp;worth and starts with an unrealistic&nbsp;timestamp so was this following a reboot? or was the previously buffered data posted correctly?</p>
<p>If this is following a reboot on a &quot;read-only&quot; OS and there are/were any lines in the log dated 1970 then you need to install &quot;ntp-backup&quot; any other scenarios will require significantly more info about your system, logs and some context, was it working ok previously?&nbsp;Did you change anything?&nbsp;Have you updated? Have you tried rebooting?</p>

     <p>Hi Paul, thanks for your answer.</p>
<p>Regarding versions :</p>
<p>Emonhub image with Linux EmonCMS 3.12.22+ #691 PREEMPT</p>
<p>EmonCMS&nbsp; 8.5.0 hosted on a self-made gentoo LAMP server, php 5.6</p>
<p>I looked at the logs gain, the out of range timestamps as gone, so I guess the buffered data just passed.</p>
<p>ntp is on, both systems are on time</p>
<p>Regarding context, I updated php from 5.5 to 5.6 since 3 weeks, but the issue has started 1 week ago.</p>
<p>I rebooted both systems without luck.</p>
<p>I self host every services I can (owncloud, roundcube &amp; mail server, IM server) and I have no issue at all except with emoncms.</p>
<p>If I can describe my monitoring system :</p>
<p>I have a rpi with emonhub that sends data from an emonth and emonth (monitoring temperatures and power from the grid) to my server.</p>
<p>I have a second rpi plugged to a Morningstar TriStar MPPT 60 solar charger that pushes data to the server via emonCMS API, monitoring solar in and out, and solar hot water.</p>
<p>I have a third one plugged to a deltasol BS2+ heating controller to monitor my wood boiling system for hot water (hot domestic water &amp; ground heating system).</p>
<p>Both Tristar MPPT and deltasol BS2+ are pushing data correctly without any errors.</p>
<p>I can provide you any needed information.</p>

     <p>Hi Anthony</p>
<p>That quite and elaborate set-up, the bits of particular interest to this issue are the&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&quot;Emonhub image with Linux EmonCMS 3.12.22+ #691 PREEMPT&quot;</em></p>
<p>and&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>&quot;I have a rpi with emonhub that sends data from an emonth and emonth (monitoring temperatures and power from the grid) to my server.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Is this Pi using a read-only OS ? can you identify the image by name or a link? the fact you call it an &quot;emonhub image&quot; suggests a pre-built image and as far as I recall all images containing emonhub have been read-only OS&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your original log shows the first timestamp as &quot;31.75&quot; as in 31.75 seconds since 1970-1-1 00:00, there was an issue on several OEM images of that (emonhub + v8.5) era that prevented NTP from accessing the previously&nbsp;saved time at boot up and/or updating that saved time for the next boot, this means that for a moment at boot up the Pi thought it was 1970-1-1 00:00 and the clock worked from that time until it was overridden by an NTP update which was dependent on a network connection. So if 31.75 seconds after booting the Pi but fractionally before a NTPupdate was performed, a data packet was received from the rfm2pi&nbsp;it would be &quot;correctly?&quot; timestamped as 31.75 as that was&nbsp;the time as far as the Pi was concerned, subsequent timestamps look correct so the NTP&nbsp;update&nbsp;seems to have occurred.</p>
<p>Without additional logs this is difficult to prove but it is my best guess based on the data supplied.</p>
<p>Search this site for &quot;ntp-backup&quot; for more info, it is a helper script for NTP on a Read-only OS, written specifically for this problem and is used on the current OEM images.</p>

     <p>Hi Paul, thanks for the ntp tip - you were right: the logs told me that emonhub was sending 1970&#39;s timestamps at boot. This is now corrected, the out of range timestamp is sorted (the pi is using a read only pre-built image).</p>
<p>I can&nbsp; confirm that the issue with emonhub not pushing emontx and emonth data is definitely with this error :</p>
<p>2016-02-21 15:46:55,180 WARNING Send failure: wanted &#39;ok&#39; but got &lt;br /&gt;<br />
&lt;b&gt;Fatal error&lt;/b&gt;:&nbsp; Call to a member function setTimezone() on boolean in &lt;b&gt;/var/www/localhost/htdocs/emoncms/Modules/input/process_model.php&lt;/b&gt; on line &lt;b&gt;669&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</p>
<p>Looks like I messed with php, but to me I made nothing significant (there is no configuration modification when moving from php5.5 to php5.6 on gentoo).</p>
<p>If I reverse to php5.5, I get the same errors.</p>

     <p>Sorry server stuff&nbsp;isn&#39;t my strong point so I cannot offer any advice there on php or the specifics of the emoncms&nbsp;error. I had assumed the error was a result of the wrong timestamp, as every packet in the batch must comply with emoncms requirements for the total batch to be accepted (or rejected) .</p>
<p>Are you still seeing this error, even with all good timestamps&nbsp;for all packets?</p>
<p>Have you checked the user timezone setting <u>again</u>&nbsp;in emoncms? at some point in v8 to 8.6&nbsp;the timezone stucture was changed and forced the user to reselect his timezone and perform a database update from the admin screen.</p>

     <p>I finally fully recompiled and installed php5.5, everything is now fine.</p>
<p>I have to figure what is different between php5.5 and 5.6, I&#39;ll post here when I&#39;ll find, some people may be interested.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot again</p>
