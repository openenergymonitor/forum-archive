        <div class="content"><p>I am using a EmonTX to monitor a PV plant and record 5 temperatures from a solar hot water tank. Everything is working like a charm but there just one more signal I need to log.</p>
<p>Hot water solar panel are provided with a PT1000 connected to a controller that regulates heat exchange with tank. There is no way for me to install a new one so I want to read it &quot;in parallel&quot; using EmonTX.</p>
<p>I believe I need a high impedance analog input able to read DC values from 0.0 to 5.0V. Is it possible to adapt the CT input 3 for such a task?</p>

     <p>Yes you can, but unless you specifically want to use the socket, it would probably be much easier to use one of the spare analogue inputs (AIO4 &amp; 5) that appear on the port headers (see <a href="../sites/default/files/emonTx-io.png" title="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/emonTx-io.png">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/emonTx-io.png</a>). Those inputs are 0 - 3.3 V but dividing the 5 V down to 3.3 V is trivial. However, you must ensure that no other connection to the emonTx is connected to earth - as the input of your controller will probably be referenced to ground and you must avoid ground loops.</p>
<p>If you want to use CT3 input, leave out C11 &amp; R17, and put a wire link in place of R15. Make R16 33 k&Omega;<span style="display: none;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span> and connect a 18 k&Omega; to the plug tip in series with your input. The plug sleeve will be your 0 V line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That will load your source with approximately 50 k&Omega; but if the source is a low impedance will present an adequately low impedance to the ADC input. The reason you want to do that is (from the Atmel data sheet):</p>
<blockquote><p>The ADC is optimized for analog signals with an output impedance of approximately 10 k&Omega; or less. If such a source is used, the sampling time will be negligible. If a source with higher impedance is used, the sampling time will depend on how long time the source needs to charge the S/H capacitor, with can vary widely. The user is recommended to only use low impedance sources with slowly varying signals, since this minimizes the required charge transfer to the S/H capacitor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clearly, increasing the resistor values will decrease the load on your output, but you might need to be careful when reading the ADC to ensure it has settled.</p>

     <p>I do something very similar to what your describing to monitor my solar hotwater, although with a stock Arduino not an EmonTX. &nbsp;In the attached display I sniff both the 46.0C and 37.8C by unobtrusively monitoring the Resol controller drive the PT1000.</p>
<p>Most controllers pulse the PT1000&nbsp;rather than energise it continuously, to avoid any self-heating effects in the probe; that&#39;s definitely how mine works. &nbsp; Have you put a voltmeter across the probe terminals? &nbsp;If you see a steady voltage then it&#39;s an easier problem, but more likely you&#39;ll see 0V and every once in a while (~2 seconds from memory on the Resol), there&#39;ll be a short sharp pulse. &nbsp;It&#39;s that pulse you need to capture and measure, and since you don&#39;t really know when it&#39;s coming, you pretty much need to dedicate an A/D converter to sniffing it constantly.</p>
<p>The other issue is you need to ensure your sniffer is always energised, or have a way to isolate it from the probe terminals when it&#39;s not (a relay or equivalent). &nbsp;The Arduino&#39;s&nbsp; A/D input impedance drops to close to nothing once it&#39;s unpowered as the protection diodes start conducting any pulse that comes in. &nbsp; My Resol immediately reports &quot;Sensor Fault&quot; &nbsp;(and shuts the circulation pump off for safety) if I power down the Arduino without disconnecting it.</p>

     <p>If you&#39;re connecting directly across the sensor and the controller input rather than the controller analogue output (which is fundamentally wrong but possibly the only way available to you), then the divider - presenting a 10 k&Omega; load with the emonTx unpowered - might well get around the &quot;Sensor Fault&quot; problem - but it might still cause unacceptable errors ( ~10 &deg;C) to the controller even when powered and presenting a 50 k&Omega; load. In that case, you might need to go to 680 k&Omega; and 390 k&Omega;, which should give an error of about 0.25 &deg;C when powered.</p>

     <p>One nice thing about the Resol controller is it displays all its temperature readings on the LCD display (to 1 decimal place) so its pretty easy to see if your load has had an impact, and also provides an easy way to calibrate your A/D readings with temperature (assuming you trust their calibration).</p>

     <p>I think maybe the best way it to use one spare analog input as Robert suggested (I ignored they existed...).</p>
<p>My solar controller is a rebranded Resol device but PT1000 probes are continiously powered as I can see a steady 1.7---1.9V on inputs. A disconnected probe input measures 5V on controller input.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I can add some load resistances between the load and the emonTX just to ensure that controller keeps working in case the sniffer is off.&nbsp; .... but this will probably mess up A/D conversion.&nbsp;<br />

	Confused...</em>&quot;</p>
<p>Why confused? My guess is the controller feeds a constant current into the PT1000 sensor - just a temperature-dependent resistor - and measures the voltage. If you add a parallel resistance, you will reduce the resistance the controller sees and reduce the temperature it indicates.</p>
<p>Therefore you want to put the <em><strong>highest</strong></em> possible resistance in parallel with the sensor to <strong><em>reduce</em></strong> the load. Now that you&#39;ve said that the normal operating voltage of your sensor is about 2 V, which is less than the 3.3 V input range of the emonTx, then all you need is a single resistor in series with the analogue input. However, because of the effect of the sample &amp; hold capacitor that I quoted earlier, you might want to put a capacitor across the input pin to ground so that the capacitor supplies the charge to the s &amp; h capacitor. I suggest a resistor value of 470 k&Omega; and a capacitor of 1nF. The series resistor and the internal protection diodes will save the analogue input from damage if the sensor becomes disconnected, and the error will be less than 1 &deg;C at 70 &deg;C even when the emonTx is not powered.</p>

     <p>For what its worth, I happened across my old calibration data in the archives (see attached photo). &nbsp;This is using an external 2.02V reference for the A/D. &nbsp;If you do the resistor maths&nbsp;with reference to the pt1000&nbsp;resistance chart, it looks like my controller is pumping about 1.371mA thru&#39; the probe. &nbsp;But given yours is a non-pulsing model, that may not be relevant to you.</p>

     <p>And remember,when doing any end-point calculations, on a good day the collector temperature can get well in excess of 100C. &nbsp; You can see in the attached graph the bottom of the tank (i.e. the cold end) hit 70C by about 10am. &nbsp; It then turns off the circulation pump to avoid blowing the tank up. &nbsp;Instead it lets the collector boil, which has a steam release valve up there. &nbsp;You&#39;ll see the circulation pump cycles for the rest of the day to keep the tank at 70C, until eventually the collector cools down at about 5pm. &nbsp;I was clearly away that day, because there was no draw on the hotwater at all.</p>

     <p>SUCCESS!</p>
<p>Thanks to your help and suggestion I made it.</p>
<p>I managed to read a PT1000 input connected to a &quot;Digisol&quot; temperature controller (a rebranded Resol).<br />
	To do this I connected a 560k&Omega; in series and a 4.7nF capacitor in parallel to the AI5 on the EmonTX.<br />
	I also had to put a software filter to smooth temperature readings since 1 bit on analog input corresponded to about 1&deg;C.<br />
	When the EmonTX is powered down the analog temperature readout on the solar controller drops by about 1.5&deg;C (this is a very good result).<br />
	If I disconnect the EmonTX, the temperature reading on the solar controller remains unchanged!! Great! Analog input is not affecting solar controller functions.</p>
<p>Now I have one analog temperature and 5 digital DS18B20 probes connected to my solar boiler. They helped me tracking down some performance issues on a bad installation.&nbsp;<em>dBC</em> plant performs much better.<br />

     <p>You could probably increase your 560k&Omega; if you want to reduce the apparent temperature drop (the 1.5&deg;C) but if you are happy with it as it is, then leave well alone. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got it working nicely.</p>
