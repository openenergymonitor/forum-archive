     <p>I give you a bit of credit because emoncms.org has an website loading problem at this moment. but seriously<u> read the manual </u>on emoncms.org/docs</p>

<ol>
<li>
		containers.. are just placeholders, boxes.. no function just for style</li>
<li>
		fill...dus fill the graph..see manual</li>
<li>
		feed value widget. just show the feed data in text. no scale, you can scale a feed at the input page (divide or sum)</li>

     <blockquote><p><em>Colour ? seems disabled, can&#39;t enter anything ?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a good question! I have mentioned it quite some time ago and I think it is still unsolved. Or can someone tell me how to set the color of a graph in a multigraph?</p>
<p>In Firefox there is only&nbsp; a # in the color selection edit field and no color picker appears at all. In Chrome the color &#39;bar&#39; shown in the edit field is always black (although the graph itself has a different default color (from where?)) and the &#39;picker&#39; does not function correctly (only if one of the pre-defined color boxes is ticked first).</p>

    <div class="content">
     <p>the colour picker is &quot;quirky&quot; in chrome. in IE it doesn&#39;t open but you can just type in the colour hex code.</p>
<p>When it opens (in chrome) you have to select one of the 16 &quot;custom colour&quot; presets, then one of the 48 &quot;basic colours&quot;. This makes the mixer panel function, once you see your chosen colour in the &quot;Colour|Solid&quot; box click &quot;add to custom colours&quot;.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">The&nbsp;&quot;custom </span>colour<span style="font-size: 12px;">&quot; preset you </span>1st<span style="font-size: 12px;"> selected should now change to your chosen </span>colour.</p>
<p>At this point you can repeat to fill some of the other 15 &quot;presets&quot; or click ok to use the selected presets colour.</p>
<p>It is the currently selected &quot;preset&quot; custom colour&nbsp;at the time the &quot;ok&quot; button is clicked that gets used, so as the presets are all black by default it appears broken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These colours appear to be retained (not sure where) and accessible for other multigraphs.</p>
<p>hope this helps, took me a while to figure it out.</p>

     <p><em>the colour picker is &quot;quirky&quot; in chrome.</em></p>
<p>&#39;quirky&#39; is the right word for it, but in Firefox it doesn&#39;t work at all. But in my opinion there is a &#39;design&#39; fault in this color selection scheme. The way it is implemented at the moment is simply not&nbsp; &#39;usable&#39; (in Firefox, and IE, and Chrome, and...).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think that one should only implement a &#39;feature&#39; if it is &#39;usable&#39;, otherwise it makes no sense. And if a newbie asks how to do something, then it is not a good idea to tell him&nbsp; to RTFM if there is an unsolved problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not know how the default colors are chosen at all. I cannot find a hint in the code. But I am only one of those old-fashioned C programmers (and BASIC, and ASM, and ALGOL, FORTRAN, Pascal, PEARL, ....) and do not have too much insight into all these new scripting languages. I am just a bit angry about me that I am not able to solve these little things myself! When I see a problem, I want to solve it. And if it&#39;s just the simple selection of a color for a graph, ........ this should not normally be a big deal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Someone able to help here?</p>

<p>I Don&#39;t know if I am missing something but the &quot;Help&quot; for the dashboards is rather sparse, and does not mention the Button, the LED, the Bar and quite a few others .As for the colour I tried using chrome and I can select&nbsp; a colour for the bar but it stays white anyway.</p>

     <p>I think the emonCMS problem is that it is very much under development, and improvements are being made and features are being added continually. An unfortunate consequence is that the documentation tends to lag behind. I&#39;ve found that the best way is to jump in and experiment. That way, you get to understand the thinking, and then it becomes easier.</p>
<p>As you are running your own copy, it is possible to edit the code to make it do whatever you want. But before you comment, I do know how impenetrable it can be, and it&#39;s going to take a lot of effort to get to know it well.</p>

     <p>Thanks Robert Yes I do understand. I&#39;m not complaining at this price lol. As long as it&#39;s not a problem if I ask what to you and others might seem a stupid question.</p>
<p>I have had a lot to learn in the last two weeks, impenetrable is putting it mildly for a first timer with any of this stuff.</p>
<p>As for stupid questions! I am looking at my dashboard at the moment on my main PC and the same dashboard on the server PC using remote control and they are different! have a look</p>

     <p>I was acknowledging that you had a legitimate question and pointing out, gently, that detailed documentation might not exist and suggesting that you should play around with it and find out. It often requires a little ingenuity and sometimes a chunk of lateral thinking. I never said your question was stupid. Sometimes, we do get stupid questions - but where it is the question that is stupid, not what they wanted to know. And then we get the just plain lazy, who find it easier to ask than spend 30 s with the site search or another search engine. It is <em>always</em> acceptable if you say &quot;I&#39;ve looked here, here and here and I can&#39;t find X&quot;. That helps everybody because the hole can be plugged. What I was trying to say, I know from personal experience that writing documentation is a lot less exciting that writing clever software; when the clever software works, there&#39;s instant gratification. When the documentation works, the only result I&#39;ve ever seen is the rate of queries slows to a trickle.</p>
<p>I do see the two dashboards are different - the appearance is generally the same but the one on the right doesn&#39;t have the feeds connected. You need to edit each graph and select the feed. I don&#39;t know emonCMS well - I&#39;ve only ever dabbled in it - so I have no idea why the feed is / has become ( ? ) disconnected. Is it a browser problem? - we know there are browser incompatibilities, I think the biggest ones are listed. Apart from that, what else is different, as with the different scales in the image, it&#39;s hard to tell? My philosophy with web pages is to write standard code and accept that the layout might not be pixel perfect every time. There are many who reckon to make the page pixel-identical on every browser, but to my mind the cost in complexity and loading times is unwarranted, and it can make for harder access (i.e. horizontal scrolling) too.</p>

     <p>In that case, it has to be a problem between the browser and the operating system and the machine. Will Firebug work with that browser? If it will, that might shed some light on where the data is being lost. Do you have the Web console and any error messages?&nbsp; What are the machines and their respective OS&#39;s?</p>

     <p>Sorry to jump in but are&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12px;">these private or public dashboards?</span></p>
<p>and are you logged in to emoncms on either or both machines?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">if public have you marked all the feeds as well as the dashboards as public and published ?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 12px;">On the right are the active dials and absent graphs reporting from the same or different feeds?</span></p>
<p>Lastly what do you get if you enter the successful &quot;ip number&quot; url in place of the &quot;localhost&quot; url on the host machine?</p>
