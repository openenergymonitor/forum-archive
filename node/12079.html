        <div class="content"><p>&quot;Rogue inputs in emoncms&quot; is&nbsp;a term that hasn&#39;t made an appearance for a while and we have always attributed&nbsp;them to rogue devices on the RFM networks. That may well be the case for many and the way emonhub&nbsp;filters nodes now may have helped reduce these from appearing but I still get them randomly.</p>
<p>I had stopped looking into them sometime ago and just delete them,&nbsp;but today I happen to notice something of great significance. I have recently helped someone setup emoncms for one of their clients. The result of that is one emonhub&nbsp;reporting to 3 emoncms accounts. Mine, theirs and the clients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I found a single new node with&nbsp;a new node id and also around 16 additional inputs tagged on to an existing&nbsp;node, the additional inputs were not updating&nbsp;although the first few inputs of that node were still updating with valid data.</p>
<p>The crucial part is that&nbsp;this only occurred on one of the 3 emoncms accounts, this means the data did not originate from the emonhub feeding all 3 accounts with identical data.</p>
<p>Either someone has posted data to that account by getting their own apikey wrong and stumbling onto this one or the data has &quot;leaked&quot; into that account from within emoncms.</p>
<p>At this time I do not know how to prove either theory, but I am interested in whether we need to extend the apikey or introduce another layer of identification eg using the account name in the url for example.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is less of a problem for single user/account servers but as I am currently trying to sell a company on the idea of their own emoncms server for their&nbsp;own clientbase I would like to figure out the cause.</p>
